        <meta name="description" property="og:description" content="The VerCors verifier is a tool for deductive verification of concurrent and parallel software. VerCors can reason about programs written in different programming languages, such as Java, C and OpenCL, where the specifications are written in terms of pre-post-condition contracts using permission-based separation logic. VerCors is able to reason about data-race freedom, memory safety, and functional correctness, and it has been applied on several realistic case studies. Several tools are being developed directly on top of VerCors by encoding their input languages to VerCors' internal representation, allowing reuse of the existing infrastructure for verification. These tools are Alpinist, Vesuv, and VeyMont.">

<p>Pallas (Program Analysis for LLVM-IR and All its Source languages) is a new project involving VerCors. Pallas aims for a universal approach to ensure correctness in programming languages based on LLVM, simplifying verification tech development. This is crucial given software's pivotal role in our lives, where failures can lead to disasters and financial losses. Software developers urgently seek techniques to improve quality, especially formal verification to prevent errors. Pallas tackles integration challenges by creating deductive program verification for LLVM-IR, applicable to any programming language that compiles to this format.</p>

<p>We wish to congratulate Jelle Bouma, Stijn de Gouw and Sung-Shik Jongmans with publishing their paper at TACAS 2023. It is titled <strong>"Multiparty Session Typing in Java, Deductively"</strong>, and it presents the BGJ tool, which checks adherence of Java code to a multiparty session type with near-zero overhead. It accomplishes this by generating contracts that encode this protocol, which can then be verified with VerCors. A preprint can be found on Sung-Shik's website: <a href="https://sungshik.github.io/">https://sungshik.github.io/</a>.</p>

The VerCors toolset can be used to verify memory safety and functional correctness of concurrent and parallel programs.
By encoding the problem into an intermediate language the power of existing tools is leveraged to support additional concurrency models.
However, for certain programs verification takes significant time. Thanks to the work of Henk Mulder, we now know why, and more importantly, what we can do about it.</p>

<p>Two PhD students will be appointed, one in Twente and one in Eindhoven, to make the development and maintenance of software aimed at graphics processing units (GPUs) more insightful and effective in terms of functional correctness and performance.</p>
<p>GPUs have an increasingly big impact on industry and academia, due to their great computational capabilities. However, in practice, one usually needs to have expert knowledge on GPU architectures to optimally gain advantage of those capabilities.
At the Eindhoven University of Technology, Wijs will work on modelling GPU applications using a Domain Specific Language, formally verifying the correctness of the models, and automatically generating GPU code.
At the University of Twente, Huisman will work on the structured optimisation of GPU code, while ensuring that functional correctness is preserved.
Existing formal verification techniques, model checking and code verification, will be combined to create, for the first time, a complete end-to-end development workflow for GPU applications.</p>
<p>To ensure the practical effectiveness of the resulting workflow, a users committee, consisting of SURFsara, the Netherlands eScience Center, Stream HPC, and CodePlay (UK), will provide real-life cases and provide feedback throughout the project.</p>
