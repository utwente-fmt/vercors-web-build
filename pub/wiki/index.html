<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p><strong>Welcome</strong> to the VerCors tutorial! In this tutorial,
we will look at what VerCors is, what it can do, and how <em>you</em>
can use it.</p>
<p>VerCors is a toolset for software verification. It can be used to
reason about programs written in Java, C, OpenCL and PVL, which is a
<em>Prototypal Verification Language</em> that is developed alongside
VerCors and often used to demonstrate and test the capabilities of
VerCors.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will first take a brief look at where VerCors
fits into the bigger picture of software verification. As this is only a
brief look, we recommend users that are unfamiliar with software
verification to take a look at the chapter <a
href="../Background">"Background"</a> that gives more information on
software verification and some of the terms used below. Then, we will
discuss the syntax of <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Prototypal-Verification-Language">PVL</a>
and <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Specification-Syntax">Specifications
in VerCors</a>. Once we have a basic idea of how things work, we look at
several more advanced concepts, either of VerCors (e.g. <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Resources-and-Predicates">resources</a>)
or of the input languages (e.g. <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Inheritance">inheritance</a>).
You can find an overview of the chapters on the right.</p>
<h2 id="vercors">VerCors</h2>
<p>VerCors is a verification tool that uses <em>static analysis</em> to
prove <em>partial correctness</em> of a given piece of code. It requires
users (e.g. software developers) to add <em>annotations in the
code</em>, which specify the expected behaviour. The chapter <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Specification-Syntax">"Specification
Syntax"</a> of this tutorial describes the syntax for these annotations.
VerCors particularly targets parallel and concurrent programs, using the
permission-based <em>Concurrent Separation Logic (CSL)</em> as its
logical foundation. CSL is a program logic that has a very strong notion
of <em>ownership</em> in the form of <em>(fractional) permissions</em>:
A thread can only read from, or write to, shared memory if it owns
enough permission to do so. An advantage of concurrent separation logic
is that, due to the explicit handling of ownership, we get properties
like data-race freedom and memory safety for free; these properties are
consequences of the soundness argument of the logic. A disadvange is
that it causes significant overhead to always deal with permissions
explicitly. Therefore, if you only wish to verify sequential algorithms,
it may be worthwhile to look at alternative tools such as <a
href="http://www.openjml.org/">OpenJML</a> and <a
href="https://www.key-project.org/">KeY</a>, which do not use CSL as
their logical foundation. For more info on CSL, ownership and
permissions, see the chapter <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Permissions">"Permissions"</a>.</p>
<p>VerCors' analysis is <em>modular</em>, proving each method in
isolation: Each method has a contract specifying the pre-conditions that
must be met before calling the method, and the post-conditions that are
certain when the method call finishes. Analysis of a method body happens
solely based on the contract, not considering any actual calling
environments.</p>
<p>While VerCors currently supports Java, C (incl. OpenMP), OpenCL and
PVL, it is designed to be extensible, in the sense that support for
other input languages with parallel and concurrent language constructs
(for example C#) can be added without much difficulty. For that, the aim
for VerCors is to allow reasoning over many different general
concurrency structures, like statically-scoped concurrency (e.g. GPU
kernels), dynamically-scoped concurrency (e.g. fork/join parallelism),
and automated parallelism (e.g. programs that are automatically
parallelised using OpenMP).</p>
<p>Note that VerCors checks for <em>partial correctness</em>, meaning
that if the program terminates, then it satisfies its post-conditions.
No proof is attempted to check whether the program actually
terminates.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that VerCors is not the only tool that can perform
static verification on annotated programs; there are actually many tools
that can do a very similar job. Examples of such tools are: <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/dafny">Dafny</a>, <a
href="http://www.openjml.org/">OpenJML</a>, <a
href="https://www.key-project.org/">KeY</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/verifast/verifast">VeriFast</a>, and <a
href="https://research.microsoft.com/vcc">VCC</a>. However, VerCors
distinguishes itself by focussing on <em>different parallel and
concurrent language constructs</em> (e.g. Dafny, OpenJML, and KeY only
allow verifying sequential programs) of <em>various high-level
programming languages</em> (e.g. VCC only allows to verify C programs).
Moreover, VerCors is not designed to be language-dependent, and instead
focusses on verification techniques for <em>general</em> concurrency
patterns.</p>
<p>Internally, VerCors uses the <a
href="https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html">Viper backend</a>,
which in turn uses the SMT solver <a
href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Z3</a>. <img

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we explain some of the terms related to VerCors, for
example <em>static analysis</em>. If you are already an experienced user
of software verification tools, feel free to skip it. If you are new to
the topic, we recommend reading this chapter to better understand the
other chapters.</p>
<h2 id="software-verification">Software Verification</h2>
<p>Nowadays, we as a society rely heavily on software, and software
errors can have a major impact, even causing deaths. Thus, software
developers strive to reduce the number of software errors as much as
possible. <em>Software verification</em> is the task of reasoning about
the behaviour of the software, in order to ensure that it behaves
correctly. The most basic case could be considered to be the compiler,
which checks that the program e.g. does not misspell a name. Only if the
compiler does not find any errors, then the program can be executed.
However, many errors that are more intricate can slip past the compiler.
To catch these, there are two possibilities: <em>Static analysis</em>
and <em>dynamic analysis</em>. Dynamic analysis runs the program and
watches its behaviour. One example is testing, where you provide the
software with a concrete input, let it compute an output and check that
it is the expected one. While this can show errors, it cannot guarantee
the absence of errors: Maybe it only works for this specific input, and
even that only in non-leap years. <em>Static analysis</em> looks at the
source code itself, and can thus reason in more general terms. The
compiler is part of this category, and so is VerCors.</p>
<p>Different tools provide different levels of analysis. As an example,
let's take a division by zero, which is not allowed in mathematics and
would cause the software to misbehave. In the most simple case, we could
search for expressions like <code>1/0</code>, which we recognise as bad
immediately. But what about <code>1/x</code>? Maybe <code>x</code> is
zero, maybe not. Some tools will check the program to find all possible
values that <code>x</code> can take. But this is often difficult to
decide, and the tools often approximate (e.g. instead of saying "-1, 1
or 2", they say "the interval [-1,2]", thereby also including the value
0 even though it cannot occur in reality). This can lead to false
results, e.g. complaining about programs that are actually correct.
Other tools require the user (meaning the software developer) to specify
which values <code>x</code> can take. This requires much more effort by
the user, who has to <em>annotate</em> the code, i.e. provide additional
information inside the program that is not needed to run the program,
but only for analysing it. As a reward for the additional effort, the
user can get more accurate results. VerCors follows this approach,
requiring the user to provide specifications as annotations. The chapter
<a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Specification-Syntax">"Specification
Syntax"</a> of this tutorial describes the syntax for these
annotations.</p>
<p>Annotations can have different purposes, and two are particularly
relevant: <em>Assertions</em> or <em>proof obligations</em> are
properties the user wants to be proven, for instance that a function
computes the correct value. <em>Assumptions</em> provide the tool with
additional knowledge to help its proof; the tool takes them as given
facts and does <em>not</em> prove them. A common example are method
pre-conditions, where the user specifies the context in which the method
is called. That way, when analysing the method itself, the tool can
reason more accurately e.g. about the values of input parameters.
However, that means that the analysis results is only applicable if the
respective assumptions are met. So users (particularly new users) should
pay attention what facts were actually proven, and what was assumed, and
be aware under which conditions the analysis result holds.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">int</span> <span class="fu">foo</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">int</span> arg<span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="dv">10</span><span class="op">/</span>arg<span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we <em>assume</em> that the method is only invoked with arguments
<code>arg&gt;0</code>, then we can <em>assert</em> (or <em>prove</em>)
that no division by zero occurs, and even that the result is between 0
and 10. Note that if the assumption is unsatisfiable (e.g. two
contradictory conditions, or a simple <code>false</code>), then we can
derive any boolean statement, because the implication "if assumption
then statement" is trivially true. Thus, users must be careful in their
choice of assumptions.</p>
<h2 id="separation-logic">Separation Logic</h2>
<p>VerCors particularly targets parallel and concurrent programs, as
they are more difficult to understand intuitively and thus are more
error-prone than sequential programs. One typical example is two parts
of the program accessing the same memory location at the same time. This
can lead to the unintuitive fact that, right after one thread wrote a
value to a variable, that variable might already have an entirely
different value due to the other thread jumping in between and changing
it. To avoid one thread invalidating the properties and invariants
maintained and observed by the other threads, VerCors uses
<em>Permission-Based Separation Logic (PBSL)</em> as its logical
foundation. PBSL is a program logic that has a very strong notion of
<em>ownership</em> in the form of <em>(fractional) permissions</em>: A
thread can only read from, or write to, shared memory if it owns enough
permission to do so. So just because a variable is on the heap, shared
and technically accessible by everyone, that does not mean that just
anyone can go ahead and use it; they need to coordinate with the others
by getting permission first. The specification language of VerCors has
constructs to deal with ownership and permissions (see the chapter <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Permissions">"Permissions"</a>).
An advantage of this approach is that, due to the explicit handling of
ownership, we get properties like data-race freedom and memory safety
for free; these properties are consequences of the soundness argument of
the logic. You will notice that the handling of permissions makes up a
significant part of the verification effort, and <em>"Insufficient
Permissions"</em> is a frequent complaint by VerCors in the beginning.
And while VerCors can be used to analyse sequential programs, it always
requires this overhead of managing permissions. Therefore, if you only
wish to verify sequential algorithms, it may be worthwhile to look at
alternative tools such as <a href="http://www.openjml.org/">OpenJML</a>
and <a href="https://www.key-project.org/">KeY</a>, which do not use
PBSL as their logical foundation.</p>
<h1 id="installing-and-running-vercors">Installing and Running
VerCors</h1>
<p>The installation and running instructions can be found on the <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors">Github homepage</a> of
this project.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax highlighting</h2>
<p>When writing a program in PVL, the Prototypal Verification Language
of VerCors, syntax highlighting can be obtained in the following
way:</p>
<p>VerCors provides syntax highlighting support for PVL in <a
href="https://macromates.com/download">TextMate 2</a> (MacOS X) and <a
href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> (Linux and Windows)
as a TextMate Bundle. The bundle is located at
<code>./util/VercorsPVL.tmbundle</code>. On MacOS X for TextMate 2 you
can simply double click the <code>.tmbundle</code> file to install it.
Sublime Text requires you to copy the bundle content to some
directory:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In Sublime Text, click on the
<code>Preferences &gt; Browse Packages…</code> menu.</li>
<li>Create a new directory and name it <code>VercorsPVL</code>.</li>
<li>Move the contents of <code>VercorsPVL.tmbundle</code> (that is, the
<code>./Syntaxes</code> directory) into the directory you just
created.</li>
<li>Restart Sublime Text.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> (VS
Code) also has support for TextMate bundles to do syntax highlighting
(VS Code runs on Windows, Linux and OSX). Click <a
href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers">here</a>
for instructions on how to install this (this has not been tested
however).</p>
<h1 id="prototypal-verification-language">Prototypal Verification
Language</h1>
<p>This page discusses the language features of PVL, the Prototypal
Verification Language of VerCors. The language is similar to Java, so it
has classes, methods, etc. It doesn't have modifiers like public and
private. This language is used for research too, so some special
constructs like the <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Tutorial-Parallel-Blocks">par-block</a>
have been added to it. This section elaborates on the basic language
features of PVL. The more advanced features are described in later
sections. A complete reference overview of the PVL language and
specification syntax can be found <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/PVL-Syntax-Reference">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="basic-types-and-expressions">Basic types and expressions</h3>
<p>Currently, VerCors supports the types <code>int</code>,
<code>boolean</code>, and <code>void</code> (for return types of
methods). Identifiers, e.g. variables and method names, can consist of
the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _. However, they must start with a
letter (a-z, A-Z). The following words are reserved and can therefore
not be used as identifiers:</p>

<li>arithmetic operators: <code>+, -, *, /, ++, --</code></li>
<li>if-then-else expression: <code>b ? e1 : e2</code> where
<code>b</code> is a boolean expressions, and <code>e1</code> and
<code>e2</code> are expressions of the same type</li>
</ul>
<p>Other expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create new object: <code>new T(...)</code> where <code>T(...)</code>
is defined by the constructor of class <code>T</code></li>
<li>Create an array: <code>new T[i]</code> where <code>T</code> is a

<code>T</code>) and <code>i</code> a non-negative integer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="classes-fields-methods">Classes, fields, methods</h3>
<p>A program consists of one of more classes. Classes have a name, zero
or more fields, zero or more constructors, and zero or more methods.
Below we show a small example class:</p>
<pre><code>class MyForest {
    int nrTrees;
    
    MyForest(int nr) {
        nrTrees = nr;
    }

    void plantTrees(int nr) {
        nrTrees = nrTrees + nr;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The keyword <code>this</code> can be used to refer to the current
object. Methods and functions may also be declared outside any class,
mimicking the behavior of static methods in Java.</p>
<h3 id="control-flow-return-if-while-for">Control flow: return, if,
while, for</h3>
<p>A method body consists of statements. The basic statements of PVL
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>assignment: <code>x = e;</code> where <code>x</code> is a variable
and <code>e</code> an expression.</li>
<li>return: <code>return e;</code>, where e is an expression of the type
of the method</li>
<li>if-statement: <code>if (b) then { s1 }</code> or
<code>if (b) then { s1 } else { s2 }</code>, where <code>b</code> is a
boolean expression and <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> are
(sequences of) statements.</li>
<li>while-loop: <code>while (b) { s1 }</code>, where <code>b</code> is a
boolean expression and <code>s1</code> a (sequence of) statement.</li>
<li>for-loop: <code>for(int i = e1; b; e2)</code>, where <code>i</code>
is an identifier <code>e1</code> is an integer expression,
<code>b</code> a boolean about <code>i</code> and <code>e2</code> an
update of <code>i</code>.</li>
<li>comments: single line comments <code>// put a comment here</code>,
or multiline comments <code>/*  put a comment here */</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below we show a method using these constructs:</p>
<pre><code>int myExampleMethod(int nr) {
    nr = nr + 3;
    if(nr &gt; 10) { /* here is a multi-line comment
                     in the if-branch */
        nr = nr-3;
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; nr &gt; 5; i++) {
            nr = nr/2;
        }
    } else { //we subtract a bit
        while (nr &gt; 2) {
            nr--;
        }
    }
    return nr + 5;
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="proof-helpers-frame-if">Proof helpers: frame, if(*)</h3>
<p>Proof helpers do not have an equivalent in regular programming
languages, but can be used to instruct the solver to take a certain
path.</p>
<p>You can use <code>if(*)</code> to encode a non-deterministic branch.
Exactly one branch of the <code>if</code> is chosen, but it is not known
to the solver which one. The syntax is as a normal if, but with the
condition <code>*</code>:</p>
<pre><code>void test() {
    if(*) {
        x[0] = 3;
    } else if(*) {
        x[1] = 8;
    } else {
        return;
    }
}</code></pre>
<h1 id="specification-syntax">Specification Syntax</h1>
<p><em>This section describes the syntax of the specification language,
which is independent of the target language. Thus, unless otherwise
stated, all features are supported for all input languages.</em></p>
<p>In this part of the tutorial, we will take a look at how
specifications are expressed in VerCors. While this tutorial provides
more detailed explanations of the various constructs, a concise list can
be found in the <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/PVL-Syntax-Reference">PVL
Syntax Reference</a> in the annex. The specification language is similar
to <a
href="http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/JML/index.shtml">JML</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the input language, specification are embedded into the
target code in two different ways: In most languages, such as Java and
C, the specifications are provided in special comments. These special
comments are either line comments starting with <code>//@</code>, or
block comments wrapped in <code>/*@</code> and <code>@*/</code>. Since
these are simply a kind of comment, regular compilers ignore them and
can still compile the program. However, the <code>@</code> signals
VerCors to interpret them as annotations. Note that this style of
comment comes from JML, so VerCors is not the only tool using them.
However, the exact interpretation of the comments may vary between
tools, so a valid specification in VerCors may not be recognised by
another tool and vice versa.</p>
<p>As an example, a method pre-condition (see following section) can
look like this:</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong> Always remember to place the <code>@</code>! It
can be aggravating to spend significant time debugging, just to realise
that parts of the specification were put in regular comments and ignored
by the tool.</p>
<p>For PVL, the specifications are inserted directly into the code,
<em>without</em> the special comments around them:</p>

<p>Given that the syntax is otherwise identical, we will use the
commented version in the rest of the tutorial, to make the separation
between specifications and target code more obvious. The examples in
this chapter are in Java, but you can find the respective examples in
other languages on the <a
href="https://vercors.ewi.utwente.nl/try_online/examples?ExampleSearch%5Bid%5D=&amp;ExampleSearch%5Btitle%5D=&amp;ExampleSearch%5Bfeature%5D=&amp;ExampleSearch%5Bsource%5D=1&amp;ExampleSearch%5Blanguagename%5D=">website</a>
(as well as a Java file of all the examples below).</p>
<p>Most annotation constructs have to end with a semicolon.</p>
<p>In principle, we can distinguish two kinds of annotations:
Specifications in the form of <em>method contracts</em> that specify the
observable behaviour of the respective method; and <em>auxiliary
annotations</em> that guide the prover towards its goal and are for
example used inside a method's body, or to define helper functions. We
will first look at the former, then at the latter, and conclude with a
description of the kind of expressions that VerCors supports (e.g.
boolean connectives). For the earlier parts, it suffices to know that
expressions in VerCors specifications are an extension of whatever
expressions the target language supports.</p>
<h2 id="method-contracts">Method Contracts</h2>
<p>Method contracts specify the behaviour of the method that is visible
to the calling environment, by means of pre-conditions and
post-conditions. <em>Pre-conditions</em> use the keyword
<code>requires</code> and restrict the situations in which the method
can be invoked, e.g. restricting parameters to be non-null.
<em>Post-conditions</em> use the keyword <code>ensures</code> and
describe the behaviour of the method by defining the program state after
the call finishes. The method contract is placed above the method
header, and these keywords can only be used in combination with a method
header.</p>
<p>Two useful keywords to define the post-state (i.e. the state after
the method finishes) are <code>\result</code> to refer to the return
value of the (non-void) method, and <code>\old(expr)</code> to refer to
the value of <code>expr</code> <em>before</em> the method's
execution.</p>

<p>Recall that VerCors analyses methods in isolation, purely based on
their contract and independent from any actual calling contexts. It
tries to prove that if the pre-condition is satisfied before the method
body is executed, then the post-condition holds afterwards. In the
example of the <code>add</code> method above, <em>if</em> the input
parameters are non-negative, <em>then</em> the result is, too. Note that
the pre-condition <code>x&gt;=0</code> is not actually required for
executing the method body, but it is necessary to prove the
post-condition. In contrast, in the example of <code>append</code>, the
pre-condition <code>xs!=null</code> is actually needed for
<code>\old(xs.length)</code> to be well-defined, and potentially to
prove absence of null-pointer dereferences in the method body. Note
that, to fully specify the correct behaviour of <code>append</code>, one
would have to compare the values inside of <code>xs</code> and
<code>\result</code>. Since these values are stored on the heap (and not
on the stack like the reference <code>xs</code> itself), this would
require access permissions, which will be introduced in the next chapter
<a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Permissions">"Permissions"</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Method contracts must not have side effects, so
for example calls to (non-pure) methods are forbidden inside contracts.
Pre- and post-conditions are processed in-order, so for example swapping
the order of two pre-conditions could result in a failed verification
(e.g. you need to specify that an integer variable is within range
before you can use it as an array index in another pre-condition). Note
that unsatisfiable pre-conditions (e.g. contradictory conditions, or
simply <code>false</code>) can lead to unexpected results, because the
implication "if pre-condition before, then post-condition after" becomes
trivially true for any post-condition, and VerCors is able to prove any
arbitrary statement.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the same expression is needed as a pre- and as a
post-condition, for example the fact that a global variable is not null.
In that case, the keyword <code>context</code> can be used as a
short-hand notation: <code>context xs != null;</code> stands for
<code>requires xs!=null; ensures xs!=null;</code>. An even further
reaching short-hand is <code>context_everywhere expr;</code>, which adds
<code>expr</code> as a pre- and as a post-condition, as well as a loop
invariant for all loops inside the method body (see below).</p>
<h2 id="auxiliary-annotations">Auxiliary Annotations</h2>
<p>When method bodies become more complicated than the toy examples
above, it becomes more difficult for VerCors to prove by itself that the
post-conditions hold after executing the method, and additional
annotations are needed inside the method body to guide the verification.
These can take the form of loop invariants, assumptions and assertions,
or ghost code. Ghost code can also occur outside of methods, for
instance to define helper functions.</p>
<h3 id="loop-invariants">Loop Invariants</h3>
<p>Loop invariants are similar to the <code>context</code> in a method
contracts, but for loops: They specify expressions that must hold before
entering the loop (like a pre-condition), as well as after each loop
iteration, incl. the last iteration (like a post-condition). Loop
invariants use the keyword <code>loop_invariant</code> and are placed
above the loop header:</p>

<p>Let us examine why this program verifies (you can skip this paragraph
if you are familiar with software verification and loop invariants): The
first loop invariant holds before we start the loop, because we
initialise both <code>i</code> and <code>res</code> to zero, and
<code>0 == 0*a</code> is true. Then in each iteration, we increase
<code>i</code> by one and <code>res</code> by <code>a</code>, so if
<code>res == i*a</code> held before the iteration, then it will also
hold afterwards. Looking at the second invariant, we see that it holds
before the loop execution because <code>i</code> is initialised to zero
and <code>b</code> is required to be greater than zero. To understand
why the invariant holds after each iteration, we also have to consider
the loop condition, <code>i&lt;b</code>. This condition has to be true
at the beginning of the iteration, otherwise the loop would have stopped
iterating. Since <code>i</code> and <code>b</code> are integers and
<code>i&lt;b</code> at the beginning of the iteration, an increment of
<code>i</code> by one during the iteration will ensure that at the end
of the iteration, <code>i&lt;=b</code> still holds. Note that if
<code>i</code> or <code>b</code> were floating point numbers,
<code>i</code> might have gone from <code>b-0.5</code> to
<code>b+0.5</code>, and we would not have been able to assert the loop
invariant. Likewise, any increment by more than one could step over
<code>b</code>. Only the combination of all these factors lets us assert
the invariant at the end of the loop iteration. When the loop stops
iterating, we know three things: Each of the two loop invariants holds,
and the loop condition does no longer hold (otherwise we would still be
iterating). Note that the combination of the second loop invariant and
the negated loop condition, <code>i&lt;=b &amp;&amp; !(i&lt;b)</code>,
ensures that <code>i==b</code>. Combining that with the first invariant
ensures the post-condition of the method.</p>
<p>Remember that VerCors checks for partial correctness, so there is no
check whether the loop actually stops iterating at some point. It just
asserts that <em>if</em> the loop stops, then the post-condition
holds.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, <code>context_everywhere expr;</code> in the
method contract will implicitly add <code>expr</code> as a loop
invariant to <em>all</em> loops in the method body. This can be useful
for expressions that hold for the entirety of the method, e.g. in the
case of <code>xs!=null</code>; but it can also be a subtle cause for
errors if it adds invariants to a loop that were not intended there
(especially in the case of multiple loops). For example, a method to
insert an element into a sorted array may add the new value at the end,
and then step by step restore the ordering of the array; in that case,
adding a sortedness property as <code>context_everywhere</code> would
not verify.</p>
<h3 id="assumptions-and-assertions">Assumptions and Assertions</h3>
<p>Sometimes, VerCors has trouble deriving a post-condition from the
given code and established facts (like pre-conditions), and it requires
explicitly specifying an intermediate step to guide the verification.
VerCors first proves these intermediate steps, and then can use them to
derive the desired facts. This can be done with the keyword
<code>assert</code>:</p>

<p>(Note that VerCors would be able to verify this example even without
the assertion, but this demonstrates how to use
<code>assert</code>.)</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong> Assertions can also be useful for debugging: If
VerCors fails to prove the post-condition, adding <code>assert</code>
statements throughout the method body can help to pinpoint where the
verification fails, either because of a shortcoming of VerCors or
because of an actual error in the code. Additionally,
<code>assert false;</code> should always fail, so if the verification
does not seem to terminate, adding such statements throughout the method
can show where VerCors gets stuck. Finally, remember that a
contradiction e.g. in the pre-conditions can imply anything; even
<code>false</code>. So <code>assert false;</code> can be used to check
that no such contradiction occurred: If it verifies, something went
seriously wrong.</p>
<p>While assertions add additional proof obligations,
<em>assumptions</em> introduce additional facts that VerCors just takes
for granted afterwards, similar to pre-conditions. This is done via the
keyword <code>assume</code>. This can be dangerous if the assumptions
contradict the actual state of the program:</p>

<p>This snippet verifies, even though the actual value of <code>y</code>
at the end is 5. However, based on the (wrong) assumptions that
<code>x==1</code> on Line 2, the assertion holds. Therefore,
<strong>assumptions should be used with caution!</strong></p>
<p>Nevertheless, assumptions can be useful, e.g. for debugging purposes.
Also, while still being in the process of verifying the code, it can be
useful to assume certain basic facts to prove the bigger picture, and
then drill deeper and prove that the assumed facts actually hold.</p>
<p>VerCors also supports a <code>refute</code> statement, which is the
opposite of <code>assert</code>. Internally, <code>refute expr;</code>
is transformed into <code>assert !(expr);</code>, i.e. asserting the
negation. Note that a failing <code>assert expr;</code> is not
equivalent to a successful <code>refute expr;</code>. For example, if we
know nothing about the value of a variable <code>a</code>, then both
<code>assert a&gt;0;</code> and <code>refute a&gt;0;</code> will fail,
as <code>a</code> <em>could</em> be greater than zero, but it also could
be less.</p>
<p>For assert, VerCors supports the following alternative syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>⊢ expr;</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ghost-code">Ghost Code</h3>
<p>Recall that annotations must never have side-effects on the program
state, otherwise the results of methods would be different between
VerCors (which takes the annotations into account) and the compiler
(which treats them as comments). However, it can be useful to extend the
program state, for example introducing additional helper variables to
keep track of intermediate results. This helper code, which only exists
for the purpose of verification, is called <em>ghost code</em>, and the
respective variables form the <em>ghost state</em>.</p>
<p>Ghost code can occur inside method bodies, but also outside, for
instance as global ghost variables. In principle, ghost code can be any
construct that the target language supports; for example when verifying
Java programs, you could define ghost classes, and in C programs, you
may use pointers in ghost code. Additionally, the ghost code can use the
extensions that the specification language adds to the target language,
such as the new type <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code> (see section
"Expressions" below).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that ghost code does not exist for the compiler, so it
cannot have side effects on the program state, and "real" code cannot
refer e.g. to ghost variables. However, it is possible to read from
"regular" variables (e.g. to create a ghost variable with the same
value).</p>
<p>When using constructs from the target language (such as variable
declarations), the keyword <code>ghost</code> is required before the use
of the construct.</p>
<p>Here is an example for ghost code inside a method:</p>

<p>The conditional addition <code>cond_add</code> is defined as a ghost
method. Otherwise, it looks like any normal method, including having a
method contract (in this case, just a single precondition). Note that
the precondition is not wrapped in the special comment <code>//@</code>,
like the precondition of <code>some_method</code> is, because the entire
ghost method already is inside a special comment <code>/*@</code>. We
then use this ghost method in the body of <code>some_method</code> (but
only inside annotations!).</p>
<h5 id="functions-and-pure-methods">Functions and Pure Methods</h5>
<p><em>Functions</em> are, in a way, a special kind of ghost methods.
They look like any method, but they are pure by design (as signified by

following an <code>=</code>, rather than a block of statements:</p>

<p>Note that the <code>ghost</code> keyword is not used: It is only
required when using a construct from the target language (e.g.
<code>if</code>, variable declarations, etc), <em>not</em> for
specification-internal constructs like defining a function. However,
using a stand-alone call statement to call the function (e.g. invoke a
lemma directly and not in an <code>assert</code>) still needs the
<code>ghost</code> keyword, as method calls are constructs from the
target language: <code>//@ ghost myLemma();</code>. The important
distinction to normal methods, apart from the fact that they have just
one expression, is that functions <em>must be pure, i.e. must be without
side-effects</em>, even on the ghost state. Thus, the body cannot
contain for instance calls to non-pure methods.</p>
<p>Remember that in VerCors, only the contract of a method is used to
reason about the behaviour of a method call, the actual behaviour of the
method body is not taken into account at this point. For functions, this
restriction is not as strict: For simple functions like the one above,
VerCors actually uses the "real" behaviour of the function to analyse
the behaviour of a call to that function. Thus, the behaviour does not
need to be specified explicitly in a post-condition, like it does for
other methods. However, this only works for simple functions, and for
example a recursive function may still need a post-condition specifying
its behaviour.</p>
<p>You can also add the <code>pure</code> keyword to a "real" method.
This indicates that the method does not have side-effects, and can
therefore be used e.g. in method contracts, while still being accessible
by the "real" code. However, for a method to be pure, it has to be
actually without side-effects, therefore only a limited number of
constructs are allowed in methods that are designated pure:
<code>if</code> statements, return statements and variable
declarations.</p>

<h5 id="abstract-methods-and-functions">Abstract Methods and
Functions</h5>
<p>Ghost functions and methods do not require a body. Sometimes, you are
only interested in the assertions that a function or method gives in its
post-condition, and do not care about the actual implementation. In such
a case, you can omit the body, turning the method or function
<em>abstract</em>. Given that method calls are usually reasoned about
only based on the contract, the call site does not see a difference
between an abstract method and a "real" method. However, this removes
the assurance that it is actually possible to derive the post-condition
from the pre-condition by some computation. Consider a post-condition
<code>false</code>: The call site will simply assume that the method
establishes its post-condition, and treat it as a known fact. Normally,
verifying the method body will check that the post-condition is actually
fulfilled; but for an abstract method, this check is missing. Since
<code>false</code> implies everything, this can easily lead to
unsoundness. Therefore, from the perspective of correctness, it is
always better to have a body proving that the post-condition can
actually be established based on the pre-condition.</p>
<p>However, making a method abstract relieves VerCors from the effort to
check that the method body actually adheres to the contract. Therefore,
it can be an interesting option to speed up the re-run of an analysis:
Once you proved that a method can indeed derive its post-condition, you
can turn the method abstract and focus on other parts of the code
without checking this method every time you re-run the analysis.</p>
<p>Syntactically, an abstract method or function has a semicolon in
place of its body:</p>

<p>Note that VerCors can also work with abstract methods that are not
ghost methods (like <code>mult</code> in the example above), but your
compiler may complain about missing method definitions.</p>
<h5 id="inline-functions">Inline Functions</h5>
<p>Inline functions are like macros in C: You can write an expression
that occurs frequently in your code as a macro and then use it as if it
were a function; but before verifying the program, VerCors replaces
every call to the inline function with the function's body as if you had
written out the body in place of the function call. Therefore, during
the analysis, the "real" behaviour of the function is taken into
account, rather than just the specification of the function's contract.
However, inline functions are only possible if the body of the function
is simple enough; for example a recursive function cannot be used in
that way, otherwise there would be an infinite loop of replacing a
function call with the body, which again contains a call. Inline
functions are declared using the <code>inline</code> keyword.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>inline</code> keyword is also used for inline

<p>There are several points of interest in this example: Note that the
pre- and post-condition of <code>some_method</code> can reference the
ghost parameter and result just like normal parameters. If the ghost
parameters and results are not just primitive integers, but heap
objects, then permissions are needed to access them, just like with
normal parameters and results (see <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Permissions">following
chapter</a>). There is no explicit <code>return</code> statement for the
ghost result; instead, the ghost result is whatever value the variable
has when the method returns. Therefore, make sure when your method
returns that you always have a defined value assigned to your ghost
result variable! In <code>other_method</code>, the <code>given</code>
keyword is followed by a list of bindings to the ghost parameters. The
parameters are named, so the assignment can be in any order, and need
not adhere to the order in which the ghost parameters are defined. Make
sure to assign a value to each ghost parameter! Otherwise, the method
will be missing a parameter, just as if you called a method
<code>void foo(int x)</code> as <code>foo();</code>. Similarly, the
<code>yields</code> keyword is followed by a block of bindings that
retrieve the yielded values. The yielded values may only be immediately
assigned to a local variable. The respective local variable,
<code>some_ghost</code>, must be a ghost variable, otherwise you would
affect the "real" program state from inside an annotation. Note that it
is not required to have an output for every yielded value. Both the
<code>given</code> and the <code>yields</code> are placed in a
specification comment between the method call and the respective
semicolon.</p>
<h3 id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, expressions in specifications are an extension of
the expressions available in the target language. So if you analyse a
Java program, you can use expressions like <code>a&amp;&amp;b</code> or
<code>x==y+1</code> in the specifications just like in Java. However,
specifications must be free of side-effects (on the program state) and
for example calls to non-pure methods are not allowed.</p>
<p>VerCors extends the expressions of the target language by a few more
features that you can use in specifications. One of them is the
implication operator <code>==&gt;</code>, which works like you would
expect from a logical implication. A common usage is
<code>requires x!=null ==&gt; &lt;some statement about fields of x&gt;</code>.
Note that the implication binds less than equality or conjunction, so
<code>a==&gt;b&amp;&amp;c</code> is equivalent to
<code>a==&gt;(b&amp;&amp;c)</code>. You need to explicitly use
parentheses if the operators shall associate differently.</p>
<p>A related new operator is the null-coalescing operator
<code>?.</code>. It can be used as <code>expr?.fun(args)</code>, which
is a shorthand for <code>expr!=null ==&gt; expr.fun(args)</code>. One
use-case, where this comes in handy, is when using predicates in the
place of the function <code>fun</code> (see chapter <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Predicates">"Predicates"</a>).</p>
<p>Two other new operators are <code>**</code> and <code>-*</code> from
separation logic. <code>**</code> is the separating conjunct, while
<code>-*</code> is the separating implication (or "magic wand"). For
more on this, see the chapters on <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Permissions">Permissions</a>
and <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Magic-Wands">Magic
Wands</a>.</p>
<p>The target language is also extended to include new data types. A
simple case is the boolean type <code>bool</code>, which can be useful
in specifications if the target language has no boolean type (e.g. old
C). If the target language does support boolean (e.g. Java), this is not
needed (but can be used nonetheless). More interestingly, the new types
include generic axiomatic data types such as <code>set&lt;T&gt;</code>
and <code>option&lt;T&gt;</code> (with <code>T</code> being a type). For
more information on them and their supported operations (such as getting
the size, and indexing elements), see the <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Axiomatic-Data-Types">respective
chapter</a>.</p>
<p>An important new type are fractions, <code>frac</code>. VerCors uses
concurrent separation logic (CSL) to manage the ownership and
permissions to access heap locations. A permission is a value from the
interval (0,1], and the type <code>frac</code> represents such a value.
To give a value to a variable of type <code>frac</code>, the new
operator of <em>fractional division</em> can be used: While
<code>2/3</code> indicates the classical integer division, which in this
example gives <code>0</code>, using the backslash instead gives a
fraction: <code>2\3</code>. For more on this topic, including some
additional keywords for short-hand notations, see the chapter <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Permissions">"Permissions"</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you might create complicated expressions and want to use
helper variables to simplify them. However, certain constructs only
allow for expressions, and not for statements such as variable
declarations. To alleviate that, there is the <code>\let</code>
construct, which defines a variable just for a single expression:
<code>( \let type name = expr1 ; expr2 )</code>, where <code>type</code>
is the type of the helper variable, <code>name</code> its name,
<code>expr1</code> defines its value, and <code>expr2</code> the
complicated expression that you can now simplify by using the helper
variable. Example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">//@ assert (\let int abs_x = (x&lt;0 ? -x : x); y==(z==null ? abs_x : 5*abs_x));</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="quantifiers">Quantifiers</h4>
<p>Note that most target languages, such as Java and C, support array
types, such as <code>int[]</code>. Sometimes, you might want to reason
about all elements of the array. To do that, VerCors supports using
<em>quantifiers</em> in the specifications:
<code>(\forall varDecl, varDecl...; cond; expr)</code>. The syntax is
similar to the header of a for loop: <code>varDecl</code> declares a
variable (e.g. <code>int i</code>); <code>cond</code> is a boolean
expression describing a boundary condition, restricting the declared
variable to the applicable cases (e.g. defining the range of the integer
<code>0&lt;=i &amp;&amp; i&lt;arr.length</code>); and <code>expr</code>
is the boolean expression you are interested in, such as a statement you
want to assert. Note that the parentheses are mandatory. Here is an
example to specify that all elements in the given array are
positive:</p>

<p>Note that in practice, you would also have to specify permissions to
access the values in the array. More on that in the <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Permissions">next
chapter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong> If you want to quantify over more than one
variable (e.g. saying <code>arr1[i] != arr2[j]</code> for all
<code>i</code> and <code>j</code>), do <em>not</em> use nesting, this
commonly hurts proof performance. Instead, use a list of bindings:
<code>(\forall int i, int j; 0&lt;=i &amp;&amp; i&lt;arr1.length &amp;&amp; 0&lt;=j &amp;&amp; j&lt;arr2.length; arr1[i]!=arr2[j])</code>.</p>
<p>If your boundary condition is an interval (like in the examples
above), you can use the shorter notation
<code>(\forall type name = e1 .. e2 ; expr)</code>, where
<code>type</code> must be an integral type (e.g. <code>int</code>),
<code>name</code> is the name of the quantified variable,
<code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code> are expressions defining the
interval bounds (lower bound inclusive, upper bound exclusive) and
<code>expr</code> is the expression you are interested in:
<code>(\forall int i = 0 .. arr.length ; arr[i]&gt;0)</code>. Note that,
depending on the circumstances, spaces are necessary around the
<code>..</code>.</p>
<p>You may freely mix normal bindings and range bindings, and omit the
condition as you like. For example, all these quantifiers are
equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(\forall int i, int j; 0 &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt; n &amp;&amp; i &lt; j &amp;&amp; j &lt; n ==&gt; xs[i] &lt; xs[j])</code></li>
<li><code>(\forall int i=0..n, int j; i &lt; j &amp;&amp; j &lt; n; xs[i] &lt; xs[j])</code></li>
<li><code>(\forall int i=0..n, int j=i+1..n; xs[i] &lt; xs[j])</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There also is an <code>\exists</code> quantifier analogous to the
<code>forall</code> quantifier:
<code>(\exists varDecl, ...; cond; expr)</code>. For instance, we could
use a similar example as above, but requiring that <em>at least one</em>
array element is positive:</p>

<p>Again, note that in practice, you would also have to specify
permissions to access the values in the array.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> <code>\forall</code> quantifiers are easier to
reason about than <code>\exists</code>, because they can be applied
indiscriminately whenever an element is encountered, while
<code>\exists</code> needs to find the element to which it can be
applied. Therefore, <code>\exists</code> quantifiers are more likely to
cause problems with VerCors (e.g. non-termination of the analysis), and
they should be <strong>used with care</strong>!</p>
<p><em>Note: Further sections explain advanced concepts: new users may
want to skip those.</em></p>
<h5 id="alternative-quantifier-syntax">Alternative quantifier
syntax</h5>
<p>In case brevity is needed for readability, you can use the
appropriate unicode symbols instead of <code>\forall</code> and
<code>\exists</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(∀varDecl+; (cond ;)? expr)</code></li>
<li><code>(∃varDecl+; (cond ;)? expr)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For <code>\forall*</code> the following alternative notations are
available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(∀*varDecl+; (cond ;)? expr)</code></li>
<li><code>(✻varDecl+; (cond;)? expr)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The IntelliJ plugin <a

&amp; Math Symbols</a> may be useful to type these symbols.</p>
<h5 id="triggers">Triggers</h5>
<p>A quantifier
<code>(\forall int i = 0 .. arr.length ; arr[i]&gt;0)</code> is a rather
generic piece of knowledge; to apply it to a concrete case, for example
when encountering <code>arr[1]</code>, the quantifier must be
<em>instantiated</em>. This basically replaces the quantified
variable(s), in this case <code>i</code>, with concrete values. But this
is only done when necessary, so when the concrete case
<code>arr[1]</code> is actually encountered. Recognising that the
quantifier must be instantiated was fairly easy in this case, but for
more complex expression it can become rather difficult. In those cases,
VerCors might use heuristics, and even randomisation. This can lead to
VerCors verifying a program successfully, and when you call it again
with the exact same program, the analysis takes forever. So if you
experience such behaviour, quantified expressions are a likely
cause.</p>
<p>To avoid that, you can explicitly tell VerCors what kind of
expression should cause instantiating the quantifier, disabling the
internal heuristics. This is called a <em>trigger</em> (or
<em>pattern</em>, e.g. by Z3); for more information see the <a
href="http://viper.ethz.ch/tutorial/?page=1&amp;section=#quantifiers">Viper
tutorial on triggers</a>. In VerCors, to mark a part of an expression as
a trigger, it is enclosed in <code>{:</code> and <code>:}</code>:</p>

<p>(Again, <a

were omitted.)</p>
<p>Note that the trigger must involve all quantified variables. So if
you have a quantifier with multiple bindings
<code>(\forall int i, int j; ... ; expr)</code>, a trigger in
<code>expr</code> must be about both <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>.
Also note that you cannot use arithmetic expressions or relations as
triggers. Most other operators e.g. about sequences and sets may appear
in triggers. For instance in the example above,
<code>{: arr[i]&gt;0 :}</code> would <strong>not</strong> be a valid
trigger.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> A wrong choice of triggers can lead to
failed verifications of true statements:</p>

<p>In this example, the first quantifier asserts that
<code>f(x/2, y) == 0</code>. From that, the second quantifier could
derive <code>f(x/2, z) == 0</code>, so the second assertion should hold.
However, the second quantifier has no trigger for <code>f(k,z)</code>,
so the quantifier does not get instantiated and the knowledge remains
hidden. Removing the trigger around <code>f(k,y)</code> in the second
quantifier leads to a successful verification, because without explicit
triggers, VerCors' heuristics finds the correct trigger
<code>f(k,z)</code> automatically.</p>
<h6 id="advanced-trigger-syntax">Advanced trigger syntax</h6>
<p>It is possible to specify multiple triggers for a single quantifier.
In this case, the solver requires all triggers to be present before
instantiating the quantifier. This also relaxes the requirement that all
bindings must occur in a trigger: instead they must collectively occur
in the set of all triggers. For example, a quantifier might state a
pairwise equality:</p>
<pre><code>(forall int i, int j; 0 &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt; |xs| &amp;&amp; 0 &lt;= j &amp;&amp; j &lt; |ys|; {:xs[i]:} + {:ys[j]:} == i + j)</code></pre>
<p>This quantifier is only instantiated when both a term of the shape
<code>xs[?]</code> and a term of the shape <code>ys[?]</code> is
encountered by the solver. <code>{xs[i], ys[i]}</code> is also referred
to as a trigger set.</p>
<p>In some cases it is useful to specify multiple trigger sets. In that
case, <em>all</em> terms must be matched of <em>any</em> of the trigger
sets. By default, a trigger is part of trigger set <code>0</code>. For
example:</p>
<pre><code>(∀`seq`&lt;T&gt; xs, int i, T t;
    0 &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt; seq_length(xs) ==&gt; {:1:seq_length({:2:seq_update(xs, i, t):}):} == {:2:seq_length(xs):})</code></pre>
<p>This quantifier is instantiated when a term of the shape
<code>seq_length(seq_update(xs, i, t))</code> is encountered,
<em>or</em> both a term of the shape <code>seq_update(xs, i, t)</code>
<em>and</em> <code>seq_length(xs)</code>. In such a case, it is required
that the <code>xs</code> appearing in both patterns are equal before the
quantifier is instantiated.</p>
<p>Finally, nested quantifiers are essentially instantiated separately:
in principle the inner quantifier is never instantiated, unless the
outer quantifier is instantiated. When specifying a trigger that is not
meant for the innermost quantifier, you can use some number of
<code>&lt;</code> symbols to indicate the trigger belongs to the
quantifier that many levels up. For example:</p>
<pre><code>(∀int i; (∀int j; {:&lt;:xs[i]:} == {:xs[j]:}))</code></pre>

<p><em>This feature is supported for all languages.</em></p>
<p>This section discusses the basics of handling ownership using a
simple toy example. Ownership is used to express whether a thread (or
synchronization object) has access to a specific element on the heap.
This access can be shared among multiple threads (or synchronization
objects), which allows the threads to read the value of this element, or
it can be unique to one, in which case the value can written to or read
from. Permission annotations are used to express ownership. We start by
considering the following simple example program, written in Java:</p>

<p>If you wish, you can store this file as, say,
<code>counter.java</code>, and try to run VerCors on this file by
running <code>vct --silicon counter.java</code> in a console (assuming
you have VerCors installed). This program currently does not contain any
annotations, but we will eventually annotate the program to verify the
following simple property: after calling the <code>incr</code> function,
the value of <code>val</code> has been increased by an amount
<code>n</code>. This can be expressed as a postcondition for the
<code>incr</code> method:
<code>ensures this.val == \old(this.val) + n</code>. The
<code>\old(_)</code> expression is used to evaluate an expression in an
earlier state. By default this is in the state as it was just after the
precondition. This is explained further <a href="#old-heap-state">later
on</a>.</p>
<p>However, if you run VerCors on this example, as it is now, you will
see that VerCors fails to verify the correctness of the program and
reports an 'AssignmentFailed: InsufficientPermission' error, since the
caller of the method has insufficient permission to access
<code>this.val</code>. First observe that <code>this.val</code> is
shared-memory; there may be other threads that also access the
<code>val</code> field, since the field is public. In order to prevent
other threads from accessing <code>this.val</code> while the calling
thread is executing <code>incr</code>, we need to specify that threads
may only call <code>c.incr</code> (on any object <code>c</code> that is
an instance of <code>Counter</code>) when they have <em>write
permission</em> for <code>c.val</code>:</p>

<p>We added three things to the counter program. The first is a
<code>requires</code> clause, which is a precondition expressing that
<code>incr</code> can only be called when the calling thread has
permission to write to <code>val</code>. The second is an
<code>ensures</code> clause, which is a postcondition expressing that,
given that the <code>incr</code> function terminates (which is trivial
in the above example), the function returns write permission for
<code>val</code> to the thread that made the call to <code>incr</code>.
The third is a postcondition that states that after <code>incr</code>
has terminated, the value of <code>this.val</code> has indeed been
increased by <code>n</code>. If you run this annotated program with
VerCors, you will see that it now passes. The remainder of this section
mostly focuses on how to use the <code>Perm</code> ownership
predicates.</p>
<p>Observe that the clause <code>Perm(this.val, 1)</code> expresses
write permission for <code>this.val</code>. Recall that VerCors has a
very explicit notion of ownership, and that ownership is expressed via
fractional permissions. The second argument to the <code>Perm</code>
predicate is a <em>fractional permission</em>; a rational number
<code>q</code> in the range <code>0 &lt; q &lt;= 1</code>. The ownership
system in VerCors enforces that all permissions for a shared memory
location together cannot exceed <code>1</code>. This implies that, if
some thread has permission <code>1</code> for a shared-memory location
at some point, then no other thread can have any permission predicate
for that location at that point, for otherwise the total amount of
permissions for that location exceeds <code>1</code> (since fractional
permissions are strictly larger than <code>0</code>). For this reason,
we refer to permission predicates of the form <code>Perm(o.f, 1)</code>
as <em>write permissions</em>, and <code>Perm(o.f, q)</code> with
<code>q &lt; 1</code> as <em>read permissions</em>. Threads are only
allowed to read from shared memory if they have read permission for that
shared memory, and may only write to shared memory if they have write
permission. In the above example, the function <code>incr</code> both
reads and writes <code>this.val</code>, which is fine: having write
permission for a field implies having read permission for that
field.</p>
<p>Let us now go a bit deeper into the ownership system of VerCors. If
one has a permission predicate <code>Perm(o.f, q)</code>, then this
predicate can be <em>split</em> into
<code>Perm(o.f, q\2) ** Perm(o.f, q\2)</code>. Moreover, a formula of
the form <code>Perm(o.f, q1) ** Perm(o.f, q2)</code> can be
<em>merged</em> back into <code>Perm(o.f, q1 + q2)</code>. For example,
if we change the program annotations as shown below, the program still
verifies successfully:</p>

<p>For splitting and merging we use the <code>**</code> operator, which
is known as the separating conjunction, a connective from separation
logic. A formula of the form <code>P ** Q</code> can be read as:
"<code>P</code>, and <em>separately</em> <code>Q</code>", and comes
somewhat close to the standard logical conjunction. In essence,
<code>P ** Q</code> expresses that the subformulas <code>P</code> and
<code>Q</code> both hold, and in addition, that all ownership resources
in <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code> are together <em>disjoint</em>,
meaning that all the permission components together do not exceed
<code>1</code> for any field. Consider the formula
<code>Perm(x.f, 1) ** Perm(y.f, 1)</code>. The permissions for a field
<code>f</code> cannot exceed <code>1</code>, therefore we can deduce
that <code>x != y</code>.</p>
<p>One may also try to verify the following alteration, which obviously
does not pass, since write permission for <code>this.val</code> is
needed, but only read permission is obtained via the precondition.
VerCors will again give an 'InsufficientPermission' failure on this
example.</p>

<p>If you replace both ownership predicates for
<code>Perm(this.val, 3/2)</code>, then the tool will report a
'MethodPreConditionUnsound: MethodPreConditionFalse' error because the
precondition can then never by satisfied by any caller, since no thread
can have permission greater than <code>1</code> for any shared-memory
location. VerCors is a verification tool for <em>partial
correctness</em>; if the precondition of a method cannot be satisfied
because it is absurd, then the program trivially verifies. To illustrate
this, try to change the precondition into <code>requires false</code>
and see what happens when running VerCors. Note that VerCors does try to
help the user identify these cases by showing a
'MethodPreConditionUnsound' if it can derive that the precondition is
unsatisfiable. But one has to be a bit careful about the assumptions
made on the program as preconditions.</p>

<p>This program does not verify and gives an 'InsufficientPermission'
failure when given to VerCors. The reason is that, also in the
specifications one cannot read from shared-memory without the required
permissions. In this program, the <code>ensures</code> clause accesses
<code>this.val</code>, however no ownership for <code>this.val</code> is
ensured by the <code>incr</code> method. Note that, without a notion of
ownership, one cannot establish the postcondition: perhaps some other
thread changed the contents of <code>this.val</code> while evaluating
the postcondition. By having a notion of ownership, no other thread can
change the contents of <code>this.val</code> while we evaluate the
postcondition of the call, since no other threads can have resources to
do so.</p>
<p>Moreover, the order of specifying permissions and functional
properties does matter. For example, the following program also does not
verify, even though it ensures enough permissions to establish the
postcondition:</p>

<p>VerCors enforces that shared-memory accesses are <em>framed</em> by
ownership resources. Before accessing <code>this.val</code> in the first
<code>ensures</code> clause, the permissions for <code>this.val</code>
must already be known! In the program given above, the access to
<code>this.val</code> in the postcondition is <em>not</em> framed by the
ownership predicate: it comes too late.</p>

<p>VerCors is able to verify the example program given above. However,
less permission for <code>this.val</code> is ensured then is required,
meaning that any thread that calls <code>c.incr</code> will need to give
up write permission for <code>c.val</code>, but only receives read
permission back in return, after <code>incr</code> has terminated. So
this example has a <em>permission leak</em>. Recall that threads need
full permission in order to write to shared heap locations, so
essentially, calling <code>c.incr</code> has the effect of losing the
ability to ever write to <code>c.val</code> again. In some cases this
can be problematic, while in other cases this can be helpful, as losing
permissions in such a way causes shared-memory to become read-only,
specification-wise. However, in the scenario given below the permission
leak will prevent successful verification:</p>

<p>In the <code>incr2</code> method, the first call <code>incr(n)</code>
will consume write permission for <code>this.val</code>, but only
produce read permission in return. Therefore, the requirements of the
second call <code>incr(n)</code> cannot be satisfied, which causes the
verification to be unsuccessful.</p>
<h2 id="some-extra-notation">Some extra notation</h2>
<p>We end the section by mentioning some notational enhancements for
handling permissions. Instead of writing <code>Perm(o.f, 1)</code>, one
may also write <code>Perm(o.f, write)</code>, which is perhaps a more
readable way to express write permission for <code>o.f</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, one can write <code>Perm(o.f, read)</code> to express a
non-zero read permission. Note that if this is used in a pre- and
postcondition, it is not guaranteed to be the same amount of
permissions. The underlying amount of permissions is an unspecified
fraction and can therefore not be merged back into a write permission.
This can be observed in the following program where the
<code>assert</code> fails:</p>

<p><code>read</code> is mostly useful for specifying immutable data
structures. One can also write <code>Value(o.f)</code> to express read
permission to <code>o.f</code>, where the value of the fractional
permission does not matter. Consequently, <code>Value</code> ownership
predicates can be split indefinitely.</p>
<p>If you instead want to express that you require some non-zero amount
of read permission and that the same amount of permission is returned
you an either add a ghost parameter of type <code>frac</code> which must
be provided at every call site to specify the amount of available read
permission, or you can use <code>AutoValue(o.f)</code>. Similarly to
<code>Value</code>, <code>AutoValue</code> expresses that some amount of
read permission is required. However, unlike <code>Value</code> no
amount of read permission is removed when <code>AutoValue</code> is
exhaled, it merely checks that there exists some amount of read
permission. When the <code>AutoValue</code> in a precondition is inhaled
you gain a symbolic non-zero, non-write amount of read permission which
must be exhaled at the end of the context again. If the same
<code>AutoValue</code> expression does not appear in the postcondition
an automatic leak check is added. Usage looks like this (unlike the
previous example the assert now passes):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] Note that <code>AutoValue</code> may only be used in
combination with <code>**</code>, <code>==&gt;</code>,
<code>\let .. in ..</code>, and <code>.. ? .. : ..</code>. For the
implication, let, and ternary expressions the <code>AutoValue</code> may
only appear on the right-hand side and in the postcondition the
left-hand side will automatically be wrapped in <code>\old(_)</code>
because the leak check must always occur at the end of the scope to
prevent unsoundness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to express that a thread has no ownership over a certain
heap element, then one can use the keyword <code>none</code>, e.g.
<code>Perm(o.f, none)</code>. This is equivalent to writing
<code>true</code>. It can be useful in situations where the amount of
permission is conditional, e.g.
<code>Perm(o.f, cond ? 1\2 : none)</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to express permissions to multiple locations, one may use
<code>\forall* vars; range; expr</code>. For example,
<code>(\forall* int j; j &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; j &lt; array.length; Perm(array[j], write)</code>
denotes that the thread has write access to all elements in
<code>array</code>. It is equivalent to writing
<code>Perm(array[0], write) ** Perm(array[1], write) ** … ** Perm(array[array.length-1], write)</code>.
Another way to specify permissions of all array elements is to use
<code>Perm(array[*], write)</code> which is equivalent to the previous
expression.</p>
<p>If you want to reason about the value that the variable refers to as
well then you can use <code>PointsTo(var, p, val)</code> which denotes
that you have permission <code>p</code>for variable <code>var</code>
which has value <code>val</code>. It is similar to saying
<code>Perm(var, p)</code> and <code>var == val</code>.</p>
<h3 id="old-heap-state">Old Heap State</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, you can use <code>\old(_)</code> to evaluate an
expression in an older state. By state here we mean strictly the heap,
and not any local variables. By default, the <code>\old</code> predicate
uses the heap just after the precondition as the heap to evaluate the
expression in. You can specify a different heap with
<code>\old[l](_)</code>, where <code>l</code> is either a ghost label
(<code>//@ ghost label l</code>) or a regular label in your input
language.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the following method:</p>

<p>Any time that an expression uses the heap to evaluate itself, we look
where the nearest <code>\old</code> expression is. For us, that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) has no <code>\old</code> above it, so it is simply the current
heap.</li>
<li>(2) has <code>\old[a]</code> as its closest parent
<code>\old</code>, so it is evaluated in the heap at label
<code>a</code></li>
<li>(3) is evaluated in the heap at label <code>b</code></li>
<li>(4) is evaluated at label <code>c</code></li>
<li>(5) is evaluated at label <code>d</code>, which is the same heap
that (1) is evaluated with</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, why is the answer <code>6006</code>? This is because the
expression <code>z.f</code> is evaluated with an old heap, but
<em>not</em> with an older value of the variable <code>z</code>. Thus:
it only counts that <code>z</code> aliases the same object as
<code>y</code> when we enter the assertion. The value for
<code>y.f</code> at all our heaps are, repspectively:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) <code>y.f == 2</code>, since we just assigned it</li>
<li>(2) <code>y.f == 2</code>, since an assignment to <code>x</code> has
no effect on <code>y</code></li>
<li>(3) <code>y.f == 2</code>, idem</li>
<li>(4) <code>y.f == 3000</code>, since we just assigned it</li>
<li>(5) <code>y.f == 3000</code> still, since the heap at (1) is the
same heap as at label <code>d</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] This is just an illustrative example, and as a matter of
style you should try to keep the expression you evaluate in an
<code>\old</code> as small as possible. Certainly it should not be
necessary to nest them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another important detail is how <code>\old</code> interacts with
<code>\unfolding</code>. (In case you are reading this tutorial in
order, you can come back to this section after reading about
predicates). The intuition is that <code>\unfolding</code> takes the
current heap, and temporarily unfolds a predicate while its body is
evaluated, whereas <code>\old</code> discards the current heap and
replaces it with a different one. The consequence of this is that
nesting them can lead to unexpected effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>\unfolding</code> nested in an <code>\old</code>: first the
<code>\old</code> has replaced the current heap, after which the
<code>\unfolding</code> unfolds a predicate in the old heap</li>
<li>An <code>\old</code> nested in an <code>\unfolding</code>: first the
<code>\unfolding</code> unfolds a predicate in the current heap, but
this action is thrown away by <code>\old</code>, since it replaces the
entire heap.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of the second situation is a program like this:</p>

<p>It is clear what the intended behaviour is: we simply want to relate
the value of <code>x</code> between the pre- and postcondition, so we
temporarily unfold it and compare the values. This does not work,
because the <code>\old</code> nested under <code>\unfolding</code>
replaces the whole heap with a heap as it was just past the
precondition. In this heap, we can derive from the precondition that it
just contains <code>state()</code>, so we do not have permission to
<code>x</code>.</p>
<p>The solution is to unfold twice: once in the current heap, and once
in the old heap. We first have to enter the old heap before we unfold
its state.</p>

<h1 id="gpgpu-verification">GPGPU Verification</h1>
<p>This section explains how to verify GPGPU programs in VerCors. The
tool supports both OpenCL and CUDA languages. The synchronization
feature (i.e., barrier) in these languages is also supported by VerCors.
To demonstrate GPGPU verification, we show two examples in both OpenCl
and CUDA, one without barrier and the other one with barrier.</p>

stores the result in another array:</p>

<p>In both examples, first we should include the header files (i.g.,
opencl.h and cuda.h). Next we obtain thread identifiers and then each
thread does the computation (lines 8-9 of OpenCL and 8-9 of CUDA
examples). As we can see obtaining the global thread identifiers are
different in OpenCL and CUDA.</p>
<p>In the specification of the methods, we specify read permission for
each thread in arrays "<em>a</em>" and "<em>b</em>" and write permission
in array "<em>c</em>" as pre- and postcondition. The keyword
"\<em>pointer_index</em>" is used with three arguments, array name,
index and permission to indicate which thread has what permission to
which location. Finally in the last postcondition we specify the result
of the methods that each location in array "<em>c</em>" contains the sum
of the values in the corresponding locations in arrays "<em>a</em>" and
"<em>b</em>". Note that in the specification we can use the shorthand
keyword "\<em>gid</em>" instead of "<em>get_global_id(0)</em>" and
"<em>threadIdx.x</em>" in the tool.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> In CUDA, to compute the global id, normally
<code>threadIdx</code> is combined with <code>blockDim</code>.
Unfortunately, <code>blockDim</code> is not yet supported in VerCors, so
the examples in this chapter only use <code>threadIdx</code>.</p>
<h3 id="openclcuda-with-barrier">OpenCL/CUDA with Barrier</h3>
<p>In GPU programming, when there is only one thread block, there is a
mechanism to sunchronize threads. This example shows an OpenCL program
that uses barrier to synchronize threads:</p>
<!-- No test is added here because I couldn't get the example working with vercors from the dev branch as of 2021-11-03.
     Besides the fact that "array.length" doesn't work (which can be worked around with "\pointer(array, size, 0)"),
     there is also a triggering problem. Some forall in the produced viper code cannot be proven, even though it is there
     as a precondition.

<p>The above examples illustrate GPU programs that rotates the elements
of an array to the left. Each thread ("<em>tid</em>") stores its right
neighbor in a temporary location (i.e., "<em>temp</em>"), except thread
"<em>size</em>-1" which stores the first element in the array (lines
15-19). Then each thread synchronizes in a barrier (line 26). After
that, each thread writes the value read into its own location at index
"<em>tid</em>" in the array (line 28).</p>
<p>We specify that there is only one thread block in the specification
of the programs using the keyword "<em>opencl_gcount</em>" (the first
precondition). The precondition of the barrier follows from the
precondition of the function and the computations before the barrier. If
the precondition of the barrier holds, the postcondition can be assumed
after the barrier. Then, the postcondition of the method can follow from
the postcondition of the barrier. Note that in the specification we can
use the shorthand keyword "\<em>lid</em>" instead of
"<em>get_local_id(0)</em>" and "<em>threadIdx.x</em>" in the tool.</p>
<h1 id="axiomatic-data-types">Axiomatic Data Types</h1>
<p><em>This section discusses axiomatic data types supported by
VerCors.</em></p>
<p>Axiomatic data types are data types that are defined by a set of
uninterpreted functions and axioms that define the behavior of these
functions. This is in contrast to concrete data types which are defined
by their implementation in a programming language such as Java or C++.
Axiomatic datatypes are not to be confused with <em>algebraic</em>
datatypes.</p>
<p>In the sections below, we are going to go over all ADTs supported by
VerCors, give the definition of each, and show examples of common
operations defined on them. A reference table can be found at the end
showing all the operations defined on the ADTs.</p>
<p>The axiomatizations used by VerCors and its back end Viper can be
found <a
href="https://github.com/viperproject/silicon/tree/master/src/main/resources/dafny_axioms">here</a>
(for sequences sets and bags) and <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/tree/dev/res/universal/res/adt">here</a>
(for the other ADTs).</p>
<p>Finally, it is also possible to create custom ADTs, though with
limited syntax support. This is discussed at the end of this
section.</p>
<h2 id="sequence">Sequence</h2>
<p>Sequences are an ordered/enumerated collection also commonly referred
to as lists. Sequences are finite and immutable (i.e. once created they
cannot be altered).</p>
<p>There are two ways to construct a sequence: the explicit syntax and
the implicit syntax. The explicit syntax requires the type of the
sequence to be explicitly defined. For example, <code>s1</code> is a
sequence of integers initialized with the values 1, 2 and 3 and
<code>s2</code> is an empty sequence of integers.</p>

<p>The implicit syntax is a shorter syntax. If the sequence is
initialized with at least one value (using the implicit syntax), VerCors
infers the type of the sequence. An empty sequence can be constructed by
providing the type of the sequence. For example, <code>s3</code> is
equivalent to <code>s1</code> and <code>s4</code> is equivalent to
<code>s2</code>. Notice how there is no space between <code>[</code> and
<code>t</code>, this is mandated by the VerCors grammar.</p>

<p>Once we have a sequence, we can query different properties of that
sequence. The syntax <code>s5[i]</code> can be used to retrieve the
element at index <code>i</code> from sequence <code>s5</code>. The
notation <code>s5.head</code> is shorthand for <code>s5[0]</code>. The
length of a sequence <code>s5</code> can be obtained by using the
notation <code>|s5|</code>. Two sequences can be compared using the
<code>==</code> operator where they are equal iff they are of the same
length and the elements at the same indices are equal.</p>

<h3 id="constructing-sequences-from-existing-sequences">Constructing
sequences from existing sequences</h3>
<p>As mentioned above sequences are immutable, however it is possible to
construct a new sequence from an existing sequence.</p>
<p>Elements can be added to a sequence in two ways. The first way is by
concatenating two sequences <code>s6 + s7</code>. This expression
represents a new sequence with the elements of <code>s6</code> followed
by the elements of <code>s7</code>. The second way is to add a single
value to the front of a sequence. The syntax <code>e::s6</code> is used
to prepend <code>e</code> at the front of <code>s6</code>.</p>

<p>It is also possible to take a subsequence from an existing sequence.
The syntax <code>s8[i..j]</code> is used to take the elements from
<code>s8</code> from index <code>i</code> to index <code>j</code>
(exclusive). By omitting either the lower bound or upper bound, one can
take or drop from a sequence. The notation <code>s8.tail</code> can be
used as a shorthand for <code>s8[1..]</code>.</p>

<h2 id="set">Set</h2>
<p>Sets are an unordered collection with unique values. Sets are finite
and immutable (i.e. once created they cannot be altered).</p>
<p>Similar to sequences, there are two ways to construct a set: the
explicit syntax and the implicit syntax. The explicit syntax requires
the type of the set explicitly defined. For example, <code>s1</code> is
a set of integers initialized with the values 1, 2 and 3 and
<code>s2</code> is an empty set of integers.</p>

<p>The implicit syntax is a shorter syntax. If the set is initialized
with at least one value (using the implicit syntax), VerCors infers the
type of the set. An empty set can be constructed by providing the type
of the set. For example, <code>s3</code> is equivalent to
<code>s1</code> and <code>s4</code> is equivalent to <code>s2</code>.
Notice how there is no space between <code>{</code> and <code>t</code>,
this is mandated by the VerCors grammar.</p>

<p>Once we have a set, we can query different properties of that set.
The length of a set <code>s5</code> can be obtained by using the
notation <code>|s5|</code>. Two set <code>s6</code> and <code>s7</code>
can be compared using the <code>==</code> operator where they are equal
iff all elements of <code>s6</code> are in <code>s7</code> and all
elements of <code>s7</code> are in <code>s6</code>. The syntax
<code>e1 \in s8</code> is used to check if set <code>s8</code> contains
the element <code>e1</code>. The <code>&lt;</code> and
<code>&lt;=</code> operators denote the strict subset and subset
operators respectively.</p>

<h3 id="set-comprehension">Set comprehension</h3>
<p><em>Please note that set comprehensions are <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/discussions/1068">currently
not supported</a>.</em></p>
<p>An advanced way to create a set is using <em>set comprehension</em>.
The syntax is <code>set&lt;T&gt; { main | variables; selector }</code>
and consists of three parts: the <code>main</code>, the
<code>variables</code> and the <code>selector</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>variables</code> are the variables that are quantified over
and these variables can be bound or unbound. From the quantified
variables, we can select specific values by using the
<code>selector</code> expression. This is a Boolean expression that
selects (a part of) the quantified variables. With the selected set of
variables to quantify over, we express the value that is going to be
part of the resulting set using the <code>main</code> expression.</p>
<p>For example, we can construct the set of all even integers from 0 to
9 as follows:</p>
<pre><code>set&lt;int&gt; {x | int x &lt;- {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; x % 2 == 0};</code></pre>
<p>To use more complex <code>main</code> expressions (i.e. non-identity
functions), it is recommended to wrap the expression in a function and
use that function in the <code>main</code> expression. For example,
suppose we have a set of integers from 0 to 5 (inclusive) and we want to
construct the set of integers where each element is doubled, we could
use set comprehension as follows:</p>

<p>The implicit syntax is a shorter syntax. If the bag is initialized
with at least one value (using the implicit syntax), VerCors infers the
type of the bag. An empty bag can be constructed by providing the type
of the bag. For example, <code>b3</code> is equivalent to
<code>b1</code> and <code>b4</code> is equivalent to <code>b2</code>.
Notice how there is no space between <code>b{</code> and <code>t</code>,
this is mandated by the VerCors grammar.</p>

<p>Once we have a bag, we can query different properties of that bag.
The length of a bag <code>b5</code> can be obtained by using the
notation <code>|b5|</code>. The syntax <code>e1 \in b6</code> is used to
get the multiplicity (or number of occurrences) of an element
<code>e1</code> in the bag <code>b6</code>. Two bags <code>b7</code> and
<code>b8</code> can be compared using the <code>==</code> operator where
they are equal iff for all elements <code>e2</code>, the multiplicity of
<code>e2</code> in <code>b7</code> and <code>b8</code> are equal. The
<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&lt;=</code> operators denote the strict
subset and subset operators respectively.</p>

<p>Maps are an unordered, collection of key/value pairs with unique
keys. Maps are finite and immutable (i.e. once created they cannot be
altered).</p>
<p>A map can be constructed using the syntax
<code>map&lt;K,V&gt; { k1 -&gt; v1, k2 -&gt; v2, ...}</code>. This
syntax constructs a map with keys/value pairs <code>(k1, v1)</code> and
<code>(k2, v2)</code> (of type <code>K</code> and type <code>V</code>
respectively). An empty map can be constructed by declaring no key/value
pair.</p>

<p>Once we have a map, we can query different properties of that map.
Given a key <code>k1</code>, we can get its associated value in map
<code>m1</code> using the syntax <code>m1[k1]</code> or
<code>m1.get(k1)</code>. The cardinality/size of the map can be queried
using the syntax <code>|m1|</code> or <code>m1.size</code>. The size of
a map is equivalent to the size of its key set. The key, value and

<code>m1.keys</code>, <code>m1.values</code> and <code>m1.items</code>

<p>A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection containing exactly two
elements.</p>
<p>A tuple can be constructed using the syntax
<code>tuple&lt;F,S&gt; { fst, snd }</code>. This syntax constructs a
tuple with the first value <code>fst</code> of type <code>F</code> and
the second value <code>snd</code> of type <code>S</code>. A tuple can
also be deconstructed into its first and second value by using the
functions <code>t2.fst</code> and <code>t2.snd</code> respectively. For
example, a tuple <code>t1</code> with values <code>(1, false)</code> is
constructed as:</p>

<p>Note however that it is easy to make mistakes and define axioms from
which false can be derived. If this happens, and your custom ADT is used
in your code or contracts, from that point on VerCors assumes false,
which makes every proof obligation after that point trivial to prove.
Furthermore, when writing quantifiers in ADTs it is important to also
define triggers. VerCors and its backend can often infer some trigger,
but these are usually suboptimal.</p>
<p>Custom ADTs are supported in all frontends.</p>
<h1 id="arrays-and-pointers">Arrays and Pointers</h1>
<p><em>This tutorial explains how to specify arrays and pointers in
vercors. Java and PVL support arrays, whereas C and the GPGPU frontends
only support pointers. The tutorial assumes you are familiar with arrays
and pointers already.</em></p>
<h2 id="array-permissions">Array permissions</h2>
<p>We have learned already how to specify ownership of variables on the
heap. Arrays generalize this concept by treating each element of the
array as a separate location on the heap. For example, you might
specify:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre
class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">/*@</span></span>
<span id="cb20-2"><a href="#cb20-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">requires ar != null &amp;&amp; ar.length == 3;</span></span>
<span id="cb20-3"><a href="#cb20-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">context Perm(ar[0], write) ** Perm(ar[1], write) ** Perm(ar[2], write);</span></span>

<p>This means we require the length to be 3, and require and return
permission over each of the elements of the array. Length is treated in
a special way here: even though it is a "field", we do not need
permission to read it, because the length of an array cannot be changed
and it is baked into Vercors.</p>
<p>Of course writing a specific length and manually asserting permission
over each location is cumbersome, so we can write a contract that
accepts arrays of any length as such:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre
class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">/*@</span></span>

<p>As mentioned in the permissions tutorial, the permissions are
combined with <code>**</code> to
<code>Perm(ar[0], write) ** Perm(ar[1], write) ** … ** Perm(ar[ar.length-1], write)</code>.
Please note the <code>*</code> after <code>forall</code>, which denotes
that the body of the forall is combined with separating conjunction
(<code>**</code>) and not boolean conjunction
(<code>&amp;&amp;</code>).</p>
<p>As you might expect, we can also use forall to specify properties
about the values of the array:</p>

<h2 id="syntactic-sugar">Syntactic sugar</h2>
<p>Specifying arrays quickly leads to prefix a lot of statements with
<code>\forall* int i; 0 &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt; ar.length;</code>, so
there is some syntactic sugar. First, you might want to use
<code>context_everywhere</code> for the permission specification of the
array, so that it is automatically propagates to loop invariants:</p>

<p>If you want to specify the length of an array, you can write as well:
<code>\array(ar, N)</code> which is equivalent to
<code>ar != null &amp;&amp; ar.length == N</code>. More interestingly,
there is also <code>\matrix(mat, M, N)</code>, which is equivalent
to:</p>
<pre><code>mat != null ** mat.length == M **
(\forall* int i; 0 &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt; M; Perm(mat[i], read)) **
(\forall int i; 0 &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt; M; mat[i].length == N) **
(\forall int i; 0 &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt; M; (\forall int j; 0 &lt;= j &amp;&amp; j &lt; M &amp;&amp; mat[i] == mat[j]; i == j))</code></pre>
<p>The last line is interesting here. In Java there is no such thing as
a true matrix: instead we can make an array of arrays. However, there is
nothing preventing you from putting the same row array instance in
multiple rows. The last statement says that if we have valid row indices
i, j, we know that <code>i != j ==&gt; mat[i] != mat[j]</code> (and the
contrapositive).</p>
<h2 id="pointers">Pointers</h2>
<p>Pointers themselves are quite well-supported, but we don't support
casting and structs in C, making the end result quite limited. For the
support that we do have, pointers can be specified with two constructs:
<code>\pointer</code> and <code>\pointer_index</code>.</p>
<p>We write <code>\pointer(p, size, perm)</code> to express that
<code>p != NULL</code>, the pointer <code>p</code> is valid from (at
least) <code>0</code> to <code>size-1</code>, and we assert
<code>perm</code> permission over those locations.</p>
<p>We write <code>\pointer_index(p, index, perm)</code> to express that
<code>p != NULL</code>, <code>(p+i)</code> is a valid location, and we
have permission <code>perm</code> at that location.</p>

<p>This could be correct: we only exhale <code>2\10</code> permission of
<code>box1.value</code>. The expression is however not well-formed:
<code>i==0</code> and <code>i==1</code> cause the expression
<code>boxes[i].value</code> to point to the same location. (Please note
that it seems that the error from our backend currently is not
propagated correctly. Silicon reports "Receiver of boxes[i].value might
not be injective." and VerCors translates this into
"ExhaleFailed:InsufficientPermission".)</p>
<p>The reason we refer to this as injectivity, is that we should be able
to construct a function that assigns bindings for a location, e.g. for a
given <code>Box</code> we can either find a unique <code>i</code> that
points to the <code>Box</code>, or the <code>Box</code> does not appear
in <code>boxes</code>. That function is the inverse of the expression in
the <code>Perm</code>. The truth value of a <code>\forall*</code>
carries with it this property of injectivity. This means, for example,
that in a method definition a requirement assumes that
<code>\forall*</code> statements are injective with repsect to
locations, whereas we must prove it in ensures statements. This usually
follows directly from a requirement. In method invokations then as per
usual it's the opposite: we must prove that <code>\forall*</code>
statements in the requirements are injective and may assume it for
ensures statements.</p>
<p>This limitation is especially important in for example arrays of
objects:</p>

<p>In common use however we have to know about duplicate elements
anyway. For example, in the example above we require <code>write</code>
permission over the boxes, so indirectly we already require all the
boxes to be distinct. As for the array elements themselves: we have an
internal axiom about arrays that expresses exactly that the locations of
an array correspond to only one index and one array.</p>
<h1 id="parallel-blocks">Parallel Blocks</h1>
<p>In this section we explain how to verify parallel algorithms by
creating parallel blocks in PVL. First, we give an example of a simple
method using parallel block. Then, we discuss a more complex example
with a barrier inside the parallel block. A barrier is used to
synchronize threads inside a parallel block.</p>

and stores the result in another array:</p>

<p>In this method there is a parallel block (lines 9-14) named
"<em>threads</em>". The keyword "<em>par</em>" is used to define a
parallel block, followed by an arbitrary name after that defines the
name of that block. Moreover, we define the number of threads in the
parallel block as well as a name for the thread identifier. In this
example, we have "<em>size</em>" threads in the range from 0 to
"<em>size</em>-1" and "<em>tid</em>" is used as thread identifier to
refer to each thread.</p>
<p>In addition to the specification of the method (lines 1-6), we add
thread-level specification to the parallel block (lines 10-11). The
precondition of the method indicates that we have read permission over
all locations in arrays "<em>a</em>" and "<em>b</em>" and write
permission for array "<em>c</em>" (lines 3-5). In the parallel block, we
specify that each thread ("<em>tid</em>") has read permission to its own
location in arrays "<em>a</em>" and "<em>b</em>" and write permission to
its own location in array "<em>c</em>" (line 10). After termination of
the parallel block as postcondition (1) we have the same permission
(line 10) and (2) the result of each location in array "<em>c</em>" is
the sum of the two corresponding locations in arrays "<em>a</em>" and
"<em>b</em>" (line 11). From the postcondition of the parallel block, we
can derive the postcondition of the method using universal quantifier
for all locations in the arrays (line 3-6).</p>

<p>Next we show an example of a parallel block which uses a barrier to
synchronize threads:</p>

<p>This example illustrates a method named "<em>leftRotation</em>" that
rotates the elements of an array to the left. In this example, we also
have "<em>size</em>" threads in the range from 0 to "<em>size</em>-1"
and "<em>tid</em>" is used as thread identifier. Inside the parallel
block each thread ("<em>tid</em>") stores its right neighbor in a
temporary location (i.e., "<em>temp</em>"), except thread
"<em>size</em>-1" which stores the first element in the array (lines
15-20). Then each thread synchronizes at the barrier (line 22). The
keyword "<em>barrier</em>" and the name of the parallel block as an
argument (e.g., "<em>threads</em>" in the example) are used to define a
barrier in PVL. After that, each thread writes the value read into its
own location at index "<em>tid</em>" in the array (line 28).</p>
<p>To verify this method in VerCors, we annotate the barrier, in
addition to the method and the parallel block. As precondition of the
method, we have read permission over all locations in the array (line
2). At the beginning of the parallel block, each thread reads from its
right neighbor, except thread "<em>size</em>-1" which reads from
location 0 (lines 16-20). Therefore, we specify read permissions as
precondition of the parallel block in lines 9-10. Since after the
barrier each thread ("<em>tid</em>") writes into its own location at
index ("<em>tid</em>"), we change the permissions in the barrier in such
that each thread has write permissions to its own location (lines
23-25). When a thread reaches the barrier, it has to fulfill the barrier
preconditions, and then it may assume the barrier postconditions.
Moreover, the barrier postconditions must follow from the barrier
preconditions.</p>
<p>As postcondition of the parallel block (1) first each thread has
write permission to its own location (this comes from the postcondition
of the barrier) in line 11 and (2) the elements are truly shifted to the
left (lines 12-13). From the postcondition of the parallel block, we can
establish the same postcondition for the method (lines 3-5).</p>
<h4 id="caution-barrier-syntax">Caution: barrier syntax</h4>
<p>In this chapter syntax is introduced for barriers. There is a caveat
to using barriers, which we want to explain first so it is not missed.
Barrier syntax in VerCors has two forms. Form 1:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb27"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb27-1"><a href="#cb27-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>barrier<span class="op">(</span>barrierName<span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb27-2"><a href="#cb27-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  requires P<span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb27-3"><a href="#cb27-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  ensures Q<span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb27-4"><a href="#cb27-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Form 2:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb28-1"><a href="#cb28-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>barrier<span class="op">(</span>barrierName<span class="op">)</span></span>
<span id="cb28-2"><a href="#cb28-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  requires P<span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb28-3"><a href="#cb28-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  ensures Q<span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb28-4"><a href="#cb28-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">{</span> <span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how in form 1, the contract is inside the curly braces. In
form 2, the contract resides between the barrier declaration and the
curly braces.</p>
<p>There is a <em>big</em> difference between these two syntaxes. In
form 1, the contract of the barrier <em>is not actually checked</em> by
VerCors. This means that if you would add <code>ensures false;</code> to
your barrier using the syntax of form 1, VerCors will not indicate this
is a problematic contract. For form 2, however, the contract <em>is
actually checked</em>. Therefore, when using barriers, form 2 should be
preferred. Form 1 should only be used if there is a proof external to
VerCors.</p>
<h3 id="complicated-parallel-blocks">Complicated Parallel Blocks</h3>
<h4 id="nested-parallel-blocks">Nested Parallel Blocks</h4>
<p>In the previous examples, we defined a parallel block of threads to
work on one-dimensional arrays. It is also possible to define
two-dimensional thread layouts to work on two-dimensional arrays. As an
example we define a two-dimensional thread layout to transpose a matrix
in parallel:</p>

<p>As we can see we use "<em>and</em>" between each parallel block
(lines 15 and 21) to define simultaneous parallel blocks. This
construction can be used in a situation where we decide to run
simultaneous instructions. That means, we do not define threads in the
parallel blocks, but the par blocks run simultaneously. Below is an
example in this situation where "<em>a</em>", "<em>b</em>" and
"<em>c</em>" are objects included a field "<em>val</em>":</p>

<p>In the above example, for each object we increase its "<em>val</em>"
by one in parallel. As we can see, thread blocks are without names and
thread identifiers in this case.</p>
<h1 id="atomics-and-locks">Atomics and Locks</h1>
<p>VerCors supports three forms of synchronization primitives. Two can
only be used in PVL: built-in locks, and atomics. One can only be used
in Java: the <code>synchronized</code> block. Each form will be
discussed individually in the next sections.</p>
<p>Warning: at the time of writing, VerCors supports only non-reentrant
locks. This means locking twice in a row is unsound, which could have
implications for code that uses Java's <code>synchronized</code>. See
the caveats section at the end of this document for more info.</p>
<h2 id="pvl-built-in-locks">PVL: Built-in locks</h2>
<p>Using built-in locks in PVL consists of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lock invariant, which describes the resources that the lock
guards</li>
<li>The <code>lock</code> statement</li>
<li>The <code>unlock</code> statement</li>
<li>The <code>commit</code> statement and <code>committed(l)</code>
expression, which indicate whether or not a lock is initialized.</li>

<p>Because a lock invariant is defined for a class, it is always related
to a specific class instance. Therefore, it is possible to make
assertions about instance fields in the lock invariant. For example, a
lock invariant could be specified that contains the permissions for a
field, and also the fact that that field must have a value greater than
10, using the following syntax:</p>

<p>The lock invariant must hold at the end of the constructor. If
VerCors cannot prove this, the program will be rejected.</p>
<p>Using Java terminology, in the above example the field <code>f</code>
is "guarded" by the built-in lock of the object that has the field
<code>f</code>. That is, to write permission for <code>this.f</code>,
and hence access to <code>this.f</code>, first the lock on
<code>this</code> needs to be acquired. This is done using the
<code>lock</code> statement, which is described in the next section.</p>

<p>Where <code>o</code> can be an arbitrary expression. The only
constraint is that <code>o</code> is not <code>null</code>. The default
lock invariant for a class is <code>true</code>, so by default
<code>lock o</code> does not give you extra information, until a
<code>lock_invariant</code> is specified.</p>
<p>The lock statement ensures that only one thread at a time can lock on
an object. Once the lock has been acquired, the lock invariant of the
object <code>o</code> may be assumed. For example, after the
<code>lock</code> statement, often fields of the object <code>o</code>
can be accessed or written to. For example, consider the code snippet
below. It is similar to the previous example, with the addition of an
increment method:</p>

<p>Notice how the lock is acquired before <code>f</code> is incremented.
Because after lock statement the lock invariant may be assumed, this
ensures the thread that is executing <code>increment</code> has
<code>write</code> permission for <code>f</code>, which in turn allows
reading and writing to <code>f</code>. Additionally, this excludes any
data races on <code>f</code>, as the thread that has the lock will be
the only thread currently incrementing <code>f</code>. We will explain
the <code>committed</code> annotation shortly.</p>
<p>The above example is still incomplete: when <code>f</code> has been
incremented, the lock should be unlocked again. This is done with the
<code>unlock</code> statement, which we describe next.</p>
<h3 id="unlock-statement"><code>unlock</code> statement</h3>
<p>The unlock statement has the following syntax:</p>
<pre class="pvl"><code>unlock o;</code></pre>
<p>Similar to the <code>lock</code> statement, <code>o</code> must be
non-null.</p>
<p>The <code>unlock</code> statement behaves as the inverse of the
<code>lock</code> statement. For the program to progress beyond
<code>unlock</code>, the lock invariant must be re-established. If this
is not possible, VerCors will reject the program. If the lock invariant
can be re-established, the lock is unlocked, and the program proceeds.
Because the lock is now unlocked, other threads can lock it, and gain
access to the resources protected by the lock.</p>
<p>In the code snippet, the previous code snippet is completed with the
missing <code>unlock</code> statement:</p>

<p>Because the only thing we did between <code>lock</code> and
<code>unlock</code> was increment <code>f</code>, the write permission
for <code>f</code> is still available, and hence VerCors can trivially
prove that the lock invariant can be re-established. Hence, this example
verifies.</p>
<h3 id="commit-statement"><code>commit</code> statement</h3>
<p>Before a lock can be locked, it must be initialized. In VerCors, a
lock is initialized when it is "committed". This is done using the
<code>commit e;</code> statement. The lock must be committed before the
end of the constructor. After any <code>commit e;</code> statement, the
expression <code>committed(e)</code> is guaranteed to be true.</p>
<p>In the following example, the lock invariant of <code>C</code>
requires permission for the field <code>f</code>, and that
<code>f</code> has value 3. The constructor writes 3 to <code>f</code>,
and then commits the invariant. This ensures that the

would occur. In addition, the postcondition contains

<h3 id="built-in-lock-caveats">Built-in lock: caveats</h3>
<p>There are several caveats to look out for when using built-in locks
in PVL.</p>
<h4 id="avoid-locking-a-lock-twice">Avoid: locking a lock twice</h4>
<p>PVL locks are non-reentrant: locking a lock twice, without unlocking
the lock inbetween, will result in a deadlock. VerCors does not warn
about this situation if it occurs. Hence, it needs to be checked
manually that this situation does not occur.</p>
<h4 id="avoid-deadlocking-interleavings">Avoid: deadlocking
interleavings</h4>
<p>Deadlocks can occur when using multiple locks. For example, consider
a situation with two locks, <code>l1</code> and <code>l2</code>. Process
A first locks <code>l1</code>, and then tries to acquire
<code>l2</code>. Process B locks <code>l2</code>, and then tries to
acquire <code>l1</code>. Since built-in locks in PVL are blocking, this
interleaving will deadlock. VerCors does not warn about this situation
if it occurs. Hence, it needs to be checked manually that this situation
does not occur, because it can otherwise allow unsoundness to occur.</p>
<h2 id="pvl-atomics">PVL: Atomics</h2>
<p>For this section, we assume you are familiar with the concept of
"lock invariant", as introduced int the previous section.</p>
<p>Atomics in PVL are used through two statements: the
<code>invariant</code> statement and the <code>atomic</code> statement.
We will discuss them separately.</p>

<p>An invariant block consists of the keyword <code>invariant</code>,
then a name, and finally an expression that is the atomic invariant of
the block. The invariant block may only occur in methods or procedures,
and may be nested, provided that the names of each invariant block are
unique.</p>
<p>The invariant block will ensure that the atomic invariant holds at
the beginning of the block. Inside the invariant block, you will not
have access to the atomic invariant, as it is removed from the state at
the beginning of the invariant block. You can get access to the atomic
invariant using the <code>atomic</code> block, which is explained in the
next section. After the invariant block, the atomic invariant may be
assumed again.</p>

<p>The atomic block consists of the keyword <code>atomic</code>,
followed by the name of the invariant the atomic block synchronizes on.
The atomic block may only occur in methods or procedures, may not be
nested, and the invariant that is referred to must enclose the atomic
block.</p>
<p>The atomic block will ensure only one thread at a time will
synchronize on the invariant. At the beginning of the atomic block, the
atomic invariant is assumed. At any point in the atomic block, this
atomic invariant can be used and broken. Finally, when the program exits
the atomic block, the atomic invariant needs to be re-established. If
VerCors cannot prove that this is always possible, VerCors will reject
the program and verification will fail.</p>
<p>The atomic block is similar to the lock invariant and
<code>lock</code>/<code>unlock</code> statements, with two subtle
differences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The synchronization done by the atomic block is scoped, so unlocking
is done automatically.</li>
<li>Declaration of the invariant is done at the method level, instead of
at the class level.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="java-synchronized">Java: synchronized</h2>
<p>The <code>synchronized</code> statement allows you to work with lock
invariants in Java. It is a combination of built-in locks from PVL, and
atomics from PVL, which are both explained in previous sections.
Specifically, VerCors supports the lock invariant syntax for Java
classes, and <code>synchronized</code> blocks work almost identically to
atomic blocks. Both concepts will be discussed in the next sections.</p>

<p>Notice how the syntax is identical to the PVL syntax, except that it
must now be placed in ghost code, as indicated by the <code>//@</code>
marker. In the above example the trivial lock invariant
<code>true</code> is used, but in principle the lock invariant can
contain the same things as in PVL: permissions about fields, arrays, and
properties about those fields and arrays.</p>
<p>The lock invariant has to hold at the end of a constructor, otherwise
verification will fail. The lock invariant is assumed at the beginning
of <code>synchronized</code> blocks, and has to be re-established at the
end of synchronized blocks. If it cannot be re-established, VerCors will
reject the program and verification will fail.</p>

<p>Note the similarity to the <code>atomic</code> block statement. The
only requirement is that <code>expr</code> is non-null and of type
class. If no lock invariant is specified on the class, the default
invariant <code>true</code> will be used.</p>
<p>The only additional behaviour of the <code>synchronized</code> expr
is that it accounts for exceptions. That is, when an exception is thrown
before the end of the synchronized block, the lock is still closed, and
hence the lock invariant still needs to be re-established.</p>
<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
<p>There are some caveats to verifying Java locks in VerCors.</p>
<h4 id="avoid-locking-in-the-constructor">Avoid: locking in the
constructor</h4>
<p>Similar to PVL, VerCors does not allow locking on an object before
the lock invariant is established. However, VerCors does not check for
this, so the user must manually ensure that this does not occur.</p>
<h4 id="avoid-locking-on-an-object-twice">Avoid: locking on an object
twice</h4>
<p>Similar to PVL, VerCors models Java's locks as single-entrant locks.
This is inaccurate, as Java's locks are actually re-entrant. We are
working on improving this, but this is currently not yet implemented.
Therefore, users have to take care that locking twice on a single object
does not occur. If it does occur, it might cause unsoundness.</p>
<h4 id="avoid-deadlocking-interleavings-1">Avoid: deadlocking
interleavings</h4>
<p>Some interleaving of <code>synchronized</code> locking sequences
might deadlock. VerCors does not warn, nor check for this. Therefore, it
is the user's responsibility to ensure that this does not occur.</p>
<h1 id="process-algebra-models">Process Algebra Models</h1>
<p>Process Algebra Models allow users to specify processes in PVL
programs. PVL programs must then be annotated to indicate which
locations in the program correspond to transitions in the process model.
Properties specified in the process model may be assumed by VerCors at
the locations in the program, provided that these properties of the
process model are proven using an external tool, such as the model
checker mCRL2.</p>
<p>Support for checking if a PVL program adheres to a process model is
automatic, and implemented in VerCors 1.4.0. Checking if a process model
adheres to the specified properties can be automated, but currently is
not, and hence has to be done manually.</p>

<h1 id="predicates">Predicates</h1>
<!-- 
* Why predicates?
  * Permissions are useful for indicating access rights and modifications to data
  * But this leaks implementation details
  * Consider the following example
    * It is clear that the counter class modifies some internal state to the client
    * But when the counter changes implementation, client code will have to be modified as well
  * It is desirable that permissions are managed such that client code does not depend on irrelevant details
  * Predicates allow this.
* Predicate syntax and usage
  * A predicate is defined as follows
    * Consists of arguments and a body where arguments can be used
  * To gain a predicate, the contents of the body must be exchanged for a predicate instance
    * This is called "folding"
  * A predicate can also be "unfolded"
    * This exchanges a predicate instance for its body
* Previous example, with predicates
  * Note how the counter class is now free to change its internal composition
  * Only relevant details are exposed through the predicate
    * In this case, the value of the counter
* Reserved/internal predicates
  * ```lock_invariant```
    * See atomics/locks
  * Threads
    * held, idle, running
    * See PVL-Syntax
* Advanced usage
  * Recursive predicates
  * Scaling & splitting
  * Inline predicates
  * Inheritance
* Known problems
  * Using predicates in while loops

<p>This section discusses syntax and semantics of predicates. First a
motivating example is given why predicates are needed. Then an overview
is given of the syntax and semantics of predicates. The introductory
example is then rewritten using predicates. Finally, we discuss some
internal and reserved predicates, and finish this part of the tutorial
with a brief overview of advanced usages of predicates and known
problems.</p>
<p>In this section, the language used for the code examples is Java.
However, the concepts presented apply to PVL as well.</p>

leaks implementation details. Consider the following example:</p>

<p>It is clear from the contract of <code>increment</code> that it
modifies the internal state of the <code>Counter</code> object.
Therefore, when <code>Counter</code> changes its internal layout, client
code will have to be modified as well. For example, if in the previous
example <code>Counter</code> adds some internal field, the client code
will also have to be changed. This is shown in the next example:</p>

<p>It is desirable that permissions are managed such that client code
does not depend on irrelevant details, to avoid this rippling effect of
modifications. Predicates help with this.</p>
<h2 id="predicate-syntax-and-usage">Predicate syntax and usage</h2>
<p>A predicate is declared as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre
class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb30-1"><a href="#cb30-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">//@ resource myPredicate(int a, bool b, ...) = body;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>A predicate consists of the name of the predicate, zero or more
arguments, and a body where arguments can be used. In Java, the
declaration must be written as a verification annotation (e.g. using
<code>//@</code>). In PVL, it is a plain declaration.</p>
<p>One can think of a predicate as a function returning type
<code>resource</code>, similar to how a permission (<code>Perm</code>)
is a <code>resource</code>. Except that, predicates are never called,
but created and destroyed using unfold and folds. We will explain this
next.</p>
<p>To create a predicate instance, the contents of the predicate body
must be exchanged for a predicate instance. This is called "folding".
Specifically, folding a predicate means any permissions present in the
predicate body are removed from the program state. In return, an
instance of the predicate is added to the state. In the following
example folding is shown. The method <code>foo</code> receives a
permission for the field <code>x</code>. At the end of the method, the
permission for this field <code>x</code> has been exchanged for an
instance of the predicate <code>state</code>. Note how the permission
for <code>x</code> and the predicate <code>state</code> are mutually
exclusive: both cannot be in the program state simultaneously.</p>

<p>The previous two examples also show that fields of the current class
can be used in the predicate body. This is because a predicate instance
is implicitly bound to an instance of the class it is defined in. The
following example verifies, because the <code>this</code> part of the
predicate instance is implicit. It also shows how to name predicates on
objects other than <code>this</code>.</p>

<p>The client only uses the predicate when expressing how it manipulates
the counter. Therefore, the counter class is now free to change its
internal composition without affecting any of its clients. This is
possible because only relevant details are exposed through the
predicate. In this case, this is the value of the counter. For example,
adding a plain field does not break the client.</p>
<p>If the interface of <code>Counter</code> changes, the client code
will have to change too. However, the client code does not have to
manage any extra permissions: it only has to specify how it uses the
interface from <code>CounterExtended</code>. The next example shows
this.</p>

<p>To summarise, predicates are very effective at hiding implementation
details. They allow encapsulation. However, predicates do not protect
the client from breaking changes. If the interface changes, any clients
will have to change too.</p>
<h2 id="reservedinternal-predicates">Reserved/internal predicates</h2>
<p>There are a few situations where VerCors attaches special meanings to
certain predicate names.</p>
<h3 id="for-atomicslocks">For atomics/locks</h3>
<p>For atomics and locks a predicate <code>lock_invariant</code> is
defined. This predicate cannot be folded/unfolded, and has to be
manipulated through locking and unlocking.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can be checked if a lock is currently held through
the <code>held(x)</code> syntax. <code>held</code> is in this case
effectively a predicate that cannot be unfolded. Therefore, any
semantics and techniques for manipulating predicates discussed in this
part of the tutorial can be applied to <code>held</code>, such as
splitting and scaling, except for folding and unfolding.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Atomics-and-Locks">Atomics
and Locks</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="threads">Threads</h3>
<p>A thread can be in several states, such as idle and running. The
syntax for this is <code>idle(thread)</code> and
<code>running(thread)</code>. <code>idle</code> and <code>running</code>
are effectively predicates that cannot be unfolded. Therefore, any
semantics and techniques for manipulating predicates discussed in this
part of the tutorial can be applied to <code>held</code> (such as
splitting and scaling).</p>
<p>See the <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/PVL-Syntax-Reference">PVL
Syntax Reference</a> section for more details.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-usage-of-predicates">Advanced usage of predicates</h2>
<h3
id="unfolding-predicates-within-expressions-using-unfolding">Unfolding
predicates within expressions using <code>\unfolding</code></h3>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to briefly open a predicate within an
expression, for example, to temporarily gain access to a field. This can
be achieved using the <code>\unfolding</code> operator. It has the
following concrete syntax:</p>
<pre><code>\unfolding myPredicate(arg1, arg2, ...) \in expression</code></pre>
<p>It takes the instance of the predicate that needs unfolding, followed
by <code>\in</code>, and then an expression in which the predicate must
be unfolded. After evaluating the internal expression, the predicate is
folded again, without any changes to the predicate or the program state.
For Java, the alternative syntax is <code>\Unfolding</code> (notice the
capital U), since <code>\unfolding</code> causes a compiler error.</p>
<p>Below is an example usage of <code>\unfolding</code> in a
<code>Cell</code> class where the predicate does not have a parameter
for the value inside the <code>Cell</code>. To work around this,
<code>\unfolding</code> is used.</p>

<h3 id="recursive-predicates">Recursive predicates</h3>
<p>Predicates can directly and indirectly recurse without problems,
provided they are not <code>inline</code>. This can be used to for
example model permissions over data structures with a size that cannot
be known statically, such as a linked list. In the below code example,
an instance of <code>state</code> predicate of the class
<code>LinkedListNode</code> contains the permission for one field, as
well as permissions for all fields of the tail of the list.
Additionally, the argument of the <code>state</code> predicate reflects
the numbers stored in the linked list.</p>

<h3 id="scaling--splitting">Scaling &amp; splitting</h3>
<p>VerCors offers syntax to specify fractions of predicates, similar to
how permissions can be specified in fractions. This can be useful to,
for example, allow one half of a state predicate to be passed to one
thread, and one to another. For a predicate <code>state(args)</code> on
a variable <code>x</code>, the syntax for specifying a fraction
<code>f</code> of the predicate is: <code>[f]x.state(args)</code>. The
code below shows an example of how scaling can be used.</p>

<h3 id="inline-predicates">Inline predicates</h3>
<p>Predicates can be given the <code>inline</code> attribute:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb35"><pre
class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb35-1"><a href="#cb35-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">class</span> C <span class="op">{</span></span>

<span id="cb35-4"><a href="#cb35-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If the <code>inline</code> attribute is given to a predicate, VerCors
will inline the definition of that predicate wherever the predicate
occurs. This means that the following code snippet:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb36"><pre
class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb36-1"><a href="#cb36-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">//@ requires c.state();</span></span>

<span id="cb36-4"><a href="#cb36-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Is equal to:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre

<span id="cb37-4"><a href="#cb37-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Because of this inlining semantics, <code>inline</code> predicates
cannot be recursive. However, besides that limitation they are equal to
regular predicates, and hence support arguments and scaling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because of this inlining semantics, folding and
unfolding inline predicates do not change the program state. However,
for the ease of flexibility, VerCors allows them, interpreting them as a
check for whether or not the contents of a predicate is present.</p>
<h3 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h3>
<p>Inheritance is not yet supported for predicates.</p>
<h3 id="thread-local-predicates">Thread-local predicates</h3>
<p>There is informal &amp; incomplete support for predicates with
thread-dependent resources. For this, the predicate must be defined with
the <code>thread_local</code> modifier. The <code>\current_thread</code>
keyword can be used inside <code>thread_local</code> predicates to get
the integer identifier of the current thread. This can be useful to
assign e.g. array indices to individual threads in a global manner.</p>
<p>To restrict the number of threads, and hence the possible values of
<code>\current_thread</code>, assumptions can be made. This can be done
either in preconditions, or in predicate bodies. For example, for some
<code>N</code>:</p>
<pre class="silver"><code>requires 0 &lt;= \current_thread &amp;&amp; \current_thread &lt; N;</code></pre>
<h2 id="known-problems">Known problems</h2>
<h3 id="vercors-crashes-when-predicates-are-unfolded">VerCors crashes
when predicates are unfolded</h3>
<p>When using predicates, VerCors might yield the following error:</p>
<pre><code>Verification aborted exceptionally: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.util.NoSuchElementException: None.get
  Cause: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.util.NoSuchElementException: None.get</code></pre>
<p>This is because the current implementation of Java inheritance in
VerCors is incomplete. There are two workarounds for this.</p>
<p>First, a predicate declaration can be marked as <code>final</code>.
This ensures that the inheritance-related logic in VerCors is not
applied to that predicate, which means it can be used as described in
this chapter. In the code below we show an example usage of this
workaround.</p>

<p>Second, if a class has many predicates, or the first workaround does
not seem to work, the whole class can be marked as <code>final</code>.
This ensures the inheritance-related logic in VerCors is not applied to
the class at all.</p>
<p>Both workarounds do not change the semantics of Java code that does
not use inheritance.</p>

<p>This will give an error on the <code>while</code> condition, stating
that there is no permission for <code>x</code>. This is to be expected,
since permission for <code>x</code> is contained in the predicate
<code>wrapX(i)</code>. Since we did not give instructions to
<code>unfold</code> it, the loop condition cannot access <code>x</code>.
Intuitively, the following extra syntax should work:</p>

<p>However, this syntax is currently <em>not</em> supported by VerCors.
Instead, it is recommended to use an inline predicate if possible (see
the <a href="#inline-predicates">Inline Predicates</a> section for more
info). Applying this workaround results in the following program:</p>

<p>Alternatively, the condition can be lifted into its own boolean
variable as in the example below. However, this 1) leads to verbose
code, and 2) requires modification of non-ghost code. Note that, for
presentation reasons, the loop condition <code>p</code> is also more
strict than in the previous examples.</p>

<h1 id="inheritance-1">Inheritance</h1>
<p>Currently, support for inheritance is very limited. Bob Rubbens is
working on improving support for inheritance as part of his PhD
position. You can read theoretical work on this in his masters thesis:
<a
href="https://essay.utwente.nl/81338/">https://essay.utwente.nl/81338/</a>,
or contact Bob at <a href="r.b.rubbens@utwente.nl"><a

support improves, this wiki page will improve accordingly.</p>
<h1 id="exceptions--goto">Exceptions &amp; Goto</h1>
<p>This section discusses support for exceptions and goto in VerCors.
The following topics are discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The support that is currently implemented and support that is still
being worked on is listed <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Exceptions-&amp;-Goto#support">here</a>.</li>
<li>Then a brief summary of exceptions in Java is given <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Exceptions-&amp;-Goto#java-exceptions-example">here</a>.</li>
<li>Then we discuss the <code>signals</code> contract clause <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Exceptions-&amp;-Goto#the-signals-clause">here</a>,
which models exceptions in VerCors.</li>
<li>Finally, support for goto is discussed <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Exceptions-&amp;-Goto#goto-and-labels">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>
<h3 id="support">Support</h3>
<p>VerCors currently only supports Java exceptions. They are not
supported in PVL. We also do not support signal handlers in C. The table

in VerCors.</p>

<p>If the <code>find</code> method encounters a negative array element
while searching, it throws an exception. The fact that the method throws
an exception at all is indicated by the <code>throws Exception</code>
modifier when the <code>find</code> method is defined. Specifically, the
exception is thrown by the <code>throw new Exception()</code> statement
in the <code>find</code> method.</p>
<p>The thrown exception is handled in the <code>main</code> method by
wrapping the call to <code>find</code> in a <code>try-catch</code>
block. Whenever an exception is thrown within a <code>try-catch</code>
block, the exception is passed to the <code>catch</code> block of the
type of the exception that matches the type of the <code>catch</code>
block. This catch block can then handle the exception to allow the
program to continue, or perform cleanup such that the program can exit
safely. If none of the catch blocks can handle the exception, it is
passed further up the call stack, possibly terminating the program if it
is not caught and handled.</p>

<h3 id="the-signals-clause">The signals clause</h3>
<p>The signals clause supported in VerCors is very similar to the
signals clauses supported in JML (documented <a
href="http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/JML/jmlrefman/jmlrefman_9.html#SEC109">here</a>).
It is a contract element like <code>requires</code> or
<code>ensures</code>, and declares the postcondition in case an
exception is thrown. The declared postcondition holds when the thrown
type matches the type stated in the <code>signals</code> clause. When an
exception is thrown, normal <code>ensures</code> post-conditions never
hold, and instead only relevant <code>signals</code> clauses hold.</p>
<p>As an artificial example, we can define a <code>signals</code> clause
for a method that sums two numbers. The method throws an exception if
one of the numers is equal to five.</p>

<p>Similar to the <code>throws</code> attribute, the

<p>A frequently occurring use-case is to guarantee that an exception is
thrown, if a certain condition occurs. Furthermore, this is also how the

one might expect the method <code>sum</code> to <em>always</em> throw if
one of the arguments equals five. However, this is not the case. The
implementation for <code>pickySum</code> below demonstrates this. The

<p>Instead, <code>pickySum</code> only throws an exception if one of the
arguments equals five, <em>and</em> today is tuesday. Would
<code>pickySum</code> be called on a monday with 5 and 10, an exception
would not be thrown, and instead 15 would be returned.</p>
<p>This artificial example shows how a signals clause should be
interpreted: when an exception of the appropriate type is thrown, the
<code>signals</code> clause can be assumed to hold. We call this the
"reactive" semantics.</p>
<p>It is <em>not</em> guaranteed that an exception is thrown if a

semantics. VerCors does <em>not</em> implement this currently.</p>
<p>If needed, there is a way to model the causal semantics using an
additional <code>ensures</code> clause. To do this, an
<code>ensures</code> clause needs to be added that implies
<code>false</code> when the <code>signals</code> condition occurs. For
example, <code>pickySum</code> can be made consistent as follows:</p>

<p>By ensuring that the method cannot terminate normally if one of the
arguments equals 5, it is guaranteed that an exception is thrown when
one of the arguments equals 5. This encodes the causal semantics using
the reactive semantics supported by VerCors.</p>
<h5 id="exception-guarantees">Exception guarantees</h5>
<p>Java guarantees that methods only throw checked exceptions if they
are explicitly mentioned in the <code>throws</code> attribute. Unchecked
exceptions can always be thrown.</p>
<p>VerCors does not implement this exact semantics. Instead, it assumes
that any exception that can be thrown is mentioned in either the
<code>throws</code> attribute or in a <code>signals</code> clause. In
other words, if a method has no <code>throws</code> clauses, nor
<code>signals</code> clauses, it is 100% exception safe according to
VerCors. A downside of this is that the VerCors exception semantics does
not 100% reflect the Java semantics. The upside is that VerCors can now
guarantee that all specified exceptions are caught, as all relevant
exceptions are stated explicitly.</p>
<p>For example, if a method does not have a <code>signals</code> clause
stating it throws a <code>RuntimeException</code>, VerCors assumes this
exception will never be thrown by the method. Another example, if a
<code>throw new RuntimeException()</code> statement occurs in method M,
VerCors will give an error if M does not have a <code>signals</code>
clause for RuntimeException.</p>
<p>In some situations it might be necessary to opt into the more
realistic Java semantics of unchecked exceptions. VerCors does not
support this directly, but it can be moddeled with an additional
<code>signals</code> clause. To do this, an additional
<code>signals</code> clause must be added with the condition
<code>true</code>. For example, we can modify the contract of the
earlier presented <code>sum</code> method to allow throwing a
<code>RuntimeException</code> randomly:</p>

<p>If this example is checked by VerCors, it will yield an error in the
<code>useSum</code> method. The error will complain that
<code>sum</code> might throw a <code>RuntimeException</code>, but that
it is not specified in the contract nor handled in the
<code>useSum</code> body.</p>
<p>A way to resolve this would be to catch the
<code>RuntimeException</code> by wrapping the call to <code>sum</code>
in a <code>try-catch</code> block. However, since catching a
<code>RuntimeException</code> is bad practice, it is sometimes better to
indicate in the contract of <code>useSum</code> that <code>useSum</code>
might also throw a <code>RuntimeException</code>. This propagates the
responsibility for handling the unchecked exception to the caller.</p>
<h3 id="the-signals_only-clause">The signals_only clause</h3>

<p>To simulate the functionality of
<code>signals_only T1, ..., Tn</code>, a signals clause with the
condition <code>true</code> can be added for each <code>Ti</code>. For
example, the clause <code>signals_only T1, T2;</code> can be simulated
by adding two <code>signals</code> clauses to a method contract as
follows:</p>

location indicated by the label <code>l</code>. For example, the
following program verifies:</p>

the choreography. Essentially, this projection preserves functional
correctness, which is proven with VerCors on the choreography, and
guarantees deadlock-freedom. In addition, contracts written in proper
form are preserved and projected to the proper endpoint. This allows
re-verification of the generated implementation, decreasing the need to
trust the implementation of VeyMont, as well as allowing modifications
to the generated implementation.</p>
<p>We will introduce the syntax of choreographies through a simple
example. Then we will show how to verify it using the permission
generation capabilities of VeyMont. Finally, we will introduce the
syntax for choreography contracts &amp; permissions, and channel
invariants. Using these, we will verify a property of the example. We
will assume the reader is familiar with PVL concepts such as
permissions, the separating conjunction, contracts and classes. At the
end of this section we will give some further directions for reading, as
well as an overview of all syntax that VeyMont supports.</p>
<h2 id="choreography-syntax">Choreography syntax</h2>
<p>Choreographies are defined using the <code>choreography</code>
keyword. They have a name, arguments, and a body. For example, the next
code snippet defines a choreography named <code>Example</code>, and has
two parameters, the integers <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>
<pre><code>choreography Example(int x, int y) {
  // Empty body
}</code></pre>
<p>The body of a choreography consists of endpoint definitions and a
single run definition. Endpoint definitions have a name, a class type,
and arguments. For example, we can add a <code>Store</code> class with
two integer fields. We then define two endpoints using the
<code>Store</code> class. We initialize the endpoints with the
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> parameters from the main arguments of
the choreography.</p>
<pre><code>class Store {
  int v;
  int temp;

  constructor(int init) {
    v = init;
  }
}

choreography Example(int x, int y) {
  endpoint alex = Store(x);
  endpoint bobby = Store(y);
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Store</code> class is a regular PVL class, for more
information we refer the reader to the PVL documentation <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/PVL-Syntax-Reference">here</a>.
It is sometimes omitted in this documentation, but it should be included
when verifying the choreography, as otherwise the program cannot be
typechecked.</p>
<p>The run definition of a choreography contains the logic of the
choreography, and determines the interactions between the endpoints. It
is defined using the <code>run</code> keyword and a block of
choreographic statements. The next example exchanges the two values
using choreographic statements. First, each endpoint sends their
<code>v</code> value to the <code>temp</code> field of the other
endpoint using the <code>communicate</code> statement. Then, each
endpoint copies the value in their <code>temp</code> fields to their
<code>v</code> fields using <code>:=</code>, the choreographic
assignment operator. The difference between choreographic assignment and
regular assignment, is that a choreographic assignment may only read and
write to memory that is owned by the endpoint being assigned to.</p>
<pre><code>choreography Example(int x, int y) {
  endpoint alex = Store(x);
  endpoint bobby = Store(y);

  run {
    communicate alex.v -&gt; bobby.temp;
    communicate bobby.v -&gt; alex.temp;
    alex.v := alex.temp;
    bobby.v := bobby.temp;
  }
}</code></pre>
<h2
id="using-veymont-choreographic-verification--permission-generation">Using
VeyMont: choreographic verification &amp; permission generation</h2>
<p>This example lacks contracts and permissions. However, it can still
be verified, and an implementation can also be generated. This can be
done using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ vercors --veymont example.pvl --generate-permissions --veymont-output example_output.pvl
[INFO] Start: VeyMont (at 10:52:56)
[INFO] Choreography verified successfully (duration: 00:00:10)
[INFO] Writing unknown.pvl to example_output.pvl
[INFO] Implementation generated successfully
[INFO] Implementation verified successfully (duration: 00:00:07)
[INFO] Done: VeyMont (at 10:53:14, duration: 00:00:17</code></pre>
<p>This command executes several steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permissions are generated according to the single-owner policy. This
means that each endpoint owns its own fields, and is not allowed to read
or write fields of other endpoints.</li>
<li>The choreography is verified. This succeeds, as the program is
memory safe: each endpoint only reads and writes its own fields.</li>
<li>An implementation is generated using the endpoint projection. All
generated permissions are projected to the endpoint that contains the
field referenced in the permissions. As the
<code>--veymont-output</code> is also present, the implementation is
also written to the path given.</li>
<li>The generated implementation is verified. This again verifies, as
expected for this simple example, because the choreography verified as
well. This is not always the case, as we will show in a later
section.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use only one of these steps, you can use the
<code>--choreography</code>, <code>--generate</code>, and
<code>--implementation</code> flags, respectively, to make veymont skip
the other steps.</p>
<h2 id="choreographic-contracts">Choreographic contracts</h2>
<p>Channel invariants &amp; choreographic contracts can be used to
specify &amp; verify functional correctness and memory safety. Using
choreographic contracts, we can manually specify the permissions that
VeyMont generated for us with the <code>--generate-permissions</code>
flag:</p>
<pre><code>class Store {
  int v;
  int temp;

  ensures Perm(v, 1) ** v == init;
  ensures Perm(temp, 1);
  constructor(int init) {
    v = init;
  }
}

choreography Example(int x, int y) {
  endpoint alex = Store(x);
  endpoint bobby = Store(y);

  requires (\endpoint alex;
    Perm(alex.v, 1) **
    Perm(alex.temp, 1));
  requires (\endpoint bobby;
    Perm(bobby.v, 1) **
    Perm(bobby.temp, 1));
  run {
    communicate alex.v -&gt; bobby.temp;
    communicate bobby.v -&gt; alex.temp;
    alex.v := alex.temp;
    bobby.v := bobby.temp;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Specifically, we add permissions to the constructor of
<code>Store</code>, and permissions to the precondition of
<code>run</code>. We use the <code>\endpoint</code> expression to
indicate the endpoint for which the expressions is relevant. The
endpoint projection uses this information to decide which endpoint to
project an expression to. VeyMont knows a very simple inference rule,
which allows us to omit the <code>\endpoint</code> expressions in some
cases. Essentially, whenever the endpoint context is directly inferrable
from the expression, VeyMont tries to do so. In this case, this shortens
the contract to the following:</p>
<pre><code>choreography Example(int x, int y) {
  endpoint alex = Store(x);
  endpoint bobby = Store(y);

  requires Perm(alex.v, 1) ** Perm(alex.temp, 1);
  requires Perm(bobby.v, 1) ** Perm(bobby.temp, 1);
  run {
    communicate alex.v -&gt; bobby.temp;
    communicate bobby.v -&gt; alex.temp;
    alex.v := alex.temp;
    bobby.v := bobby.temp;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>VeyMont verifies the above two examples successfully.</p>
<h2 id="channel-invariants--functional-correctness">Channel invariants
&amp; functional correctness</h2>
<p>We will now go one step further and specify functional correctness of
the above example. Specifically, we will verify that, if <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code> are positive and negative respectively, the fields
<code>bobby.v</code> and <code>alex.v</code> will also be positive and
negative, respectively, after executing the choreography. We do this by
adding a contract to the main choreography, to constrain <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code>. We also enhance the contract of <code>run</code> by
adding this requirement. This results in the following choreography:</p>
<pre><code>requires x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 0;
choreography Example(int x, int y) {
  endpoint alex = Store(x);
  endpoint bobby = Store(y);

  requires Perm(alex.v, 1) ** Perm(alex.temp, 1) ** alex.v &gt; 0;
  requires Perm(bobby.v, 1) ** Perm(bobby.temp, 1) ** bobby.v &lt; 0;
  ensures Perm(alex.v, 1) ** alex.v &lt; 0;
  ensures Perm(bobby.v, 1) ** bobby.v &gt; 0;
  run {
    communicate alex.v -&gt; bobby.temp;
    communicate bobby.v -&gt; alex.temp;
    alex.v := alex.temp;
    bobby.v := bobby.temp;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This version does not yet verify. VeyMont reports an error on the
postcondition of the above choreograpy, reporting that
<code>alex.v</code> and <code>bob.v</code> might not be negative and
positive, respectively. Note that this error is discovered only after
the choreography is verified! This shows an interesting aspect of
VeyMont: at the choreography level, properties over the transferred
values are included in the reasoning of VeyMont. While this is only
matters for primitive values like integers, it is ocasionally useful for
verifying choreographies. Note that, while the generated implementation
would not verify, it is not because of a bug: there are simply some
annotations missing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In deductive program verification terms, there is a modularity
boundary at the communicate statement, in the sense of modular
verification. When verifying the choreography, this modularity boundary
is transparent. When verifying the implementation, this modularity
boundary is opaque. The decision of when and where to draw the
modularity boundary is a topic of ongoing research, and might change in
future versions of VeyMont.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will now finish verifying the implementation by adding a property
over the message that is sent. This type of property is specified using
a channel invariant. Channel invariants are defined using the
<code>channel_invariant</code> keyword, followed by an expression.
Channel invariants must directly precede the communicate statement they
apply to. Within a channel invariant, the special expressions
<code>\msg</code>, <code>\sender</code> and <code>\receiver</code> are
available. They refer to the message being sent, the sending and the
receiving endpoint, respectively. Within a channel invariant, there can
be no endpoint ownership expressions, as the owners are implictly
determined by the sending and receiving endpoint.</p>
<p>Adding the constraints as channel invariants results in the following
choreography:</p>
<pre><code>requires x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 0;
choreography Example(int x, int y) {
  endpoint alex = Store(x);
  endpoint bobby = Store(y);

  requires Perm(alex.v, 1) ** Perm(alex.temp, 1) ** alex.v &gt; 0;
  requires Perm(bobby.v, 1) ** Perm(bobby.temp, 1) ** bobby.v &lt; 0;
  ensures Perm(alex.v, 1) ** alex.v &lt; 0;
  ensures Perm(bobby.v, 1) ** bobby.v &gt; 0;
  run {
    channel_invariant \msg &gt; 0;
    communicate alex.v -&gt; bobby.temp;
    channel_invariant \msg &lt; 0;
    communicate bobby.v -&gt; alex.temp;
    alex.v := alex.temp;
    bobby.v := bobby.temp;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>The generated implementation of this final version of the
choreography verifies.</p>

<h1 id="term-rewriting-rules">Term Rewriting Rules</h1>
<p>VerCors allows you to define your own term rewriting rules via
<code>pvl</code> files. This chapter shows you how.</p>
<h1 id="magic-wands">Magic Wands</h1>
<p>The handling of magic wands is non-trivial, so this chapter takes a
closer look at that. For further reading, see e.g. <em>"Witnessing the
elimination of magic wands". Blom, S.; and Huisman, M. STTT, 17(6):
757–781. 2015</em>.</p>
<p>Also take a look at the Viper tutorial for wands: <a
href="http://viper.ethz.ch/tutorial/?page=1&amp;section=#magic-wands">http://viper.ethz.ch/tutorial/?page=1&amp;section=#magic-wands</a></p>
<!-- PB: note to editor: if VerCors starts supporting "\applying" in contracts, please edit the section about \old where it is explained how \old interacts with \unfolding -->

<h2 id="what-are-magic-wands">What are Magic Wands?</h2>
<p>The "Magic Wand" or <em>separating implication</em> is a connective
in separation logic using the symbol <code>-*</code>. It represents a
part of a resource (see <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki/Predicates">"Predicates"</a>)
or "resource with a hole": <code>A -* B</code> means "if you give me an
<code>A</code>, I can give you a <code>B</code> in return". Thus, it is
similar to a logical implication <code>A ==&gt; B</code>; however, it
consumes the <code>A</code> when it is exchanged for a
<code>B</code>.</p>
<p>A common use case is if you have a predicate defining a recursive
data structure like a linked list or a binary tree, and you take a part
of that data structure to reason about explicitly, like a sub-tree. You
can use the recursive predicate to reason about the sub-tree, but it is
more difficult to reason about the <em>remainder</em> of the original
tree: Since you took out the sub-tree and have explicit permission for
it, the recursive predicate for the whole tree can no longer have the
permission for that part, so it would have to stop recursing at a
certain point. With a wand, you can resolve this: For a tree
<code>T</code> with left sub-tree <code>L</code> and right sub-tree
<code>R</code>, and a recursive predicate <code>Tree(x)</code>, you can
split <code>Tree(T)</code> into
<code>Tree(L) ** (Tree(L)-*Tree(T))</code>. So you have the explicit
resource for the left sub-tree, and a wand such that if you join the
sub-tree back into it, you get the predicate for the whole tree back.
This joining is called <em>applying</em> the wand.</p>

<p>So a <code>Tree</code> contains a data item <code>value</code>, a
priority and two references to the sub-trees; the <code>tree</code>
resource contains write permissions for all those fields, as well as
recursive permissions for the sub-trees; and the <code>sorted</code>
function ensures that the priority in the root node is the largest in
the <code>Tree</code> (like in a priority queue).</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-wand">Creating a Wand</h3>
<p>To create a wand, use the keyword <code>create {...}</code>. Inside
the curly braces, you have to provide the necessary information to
create the wand:</p>
<p>You need to explicitly specify which resources from the current
context should be folded into the wand. The keyword for this is
<code>use</code>. Note that, like with folding a normal predicated, any
permissions folded into the wand are no longer available in the
environment. You can also <code>use</code> boolean facts from the
current context, e.g. <code>use a==b;</code>.</p>
<p>When creating a wand <code>A-*B</code>, you need to describe how
exactly to merge <code>A</code> with the content of the wand to obtain
<code>B</code>. For example, <code>A</code> may contain permissions for
the left sub-tree and the wand those for the right sub-tree, and to get
the full tree, you need to perform a <code>fold</code>. All necessary
permissions and boolean facts for such a merger must be provided via
<code>use</code>.</p>
<p>The final statement within the curly braces of <code>create</code>
has to be <code>qed A-*B;</code>, with <code>A-*B</code> being replaced
by the wand you created.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that the wand operator <code>-*</code> has the
precedence like an implication, thus it is less binding than the
separating conjunct <code>**</code> and boolean connectives like
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>.</p>

<p>Notice how in the example, all the permissions necessary for folding
<code>tree(t)</code> are provided with <code>use</code>,
<strong>except</strong> the part that is in the premise of the wand,
<code>tree(t.left)</code>. If we had provided that as well, it would
have become part of the wand, rather than being the "missing piece", and
the first post-condition <code>ensures tree(\result)</code> would have
failed for lack of permission (since this permission is bundled into the
wand, and no longer directly available). Additionally, we had to provide
the fact that <code>res</code> is the left sub-tree of <code>t</code>,
so that <code>fold tree(t)</code> knows that the premise of the wand
fits into the missing part of the predicate.</p>
<h3 id="applying-a-wand">Applying a Wand</h3>
<p>To combine the "missing piece" with the wand and obtain the full
resource, use the keyword <code>apply</code>. Since we already specified
how the merging works when we created the wand, no further logic is
needed now:</p>

<h3 id="more-complex-expressions">More Complex Expressions</h3>
<p>Sometimes, we may want to reason about the things contained in a
wand; for example we decompose a sorted tree, and want to say it will be
sorted again after the merger. However, as long as <code>tree(t)</code>
is split into the sub-tree and the wand, we cannot call
<code>sorted(t)</code> as it needs the full predicate
<code>tree(t)</code>. But simply ignoring the sortedness when splitting
and later merging again would mean that we can no longer make any
assertions about sortedness afterwards. As a solution, we encode the
property into the wand, by adding conjuncts to the premise and
antecedence of the wand: <code>A**B -* C**D</code>. We can only apply
such a wand if we hold the permissions of <code>A</code> <em>and</em>
the properties in <code>B</code> hold. This stricter requirement is
rewarded with the fact that we will get both the permissions in
<code>C</code> and the properties of <code>D</code> after applying the
wand.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that VerCors currently only allows method calls
as conjuncts in wands, so properties like an equality <code>a==b</code>
must be wrapped in a function in order to be used.</p>

<p>Now, when creating the wand, we need to <code>use</code> additional
information in order to be able to ensure sortedness after the merger:
The condition for the right side can simply be provided. The condition
for the left side is part of the premise of the wand (in particular
<code>sorted</code>). The comparison between the priority of the root
and the priority of the left node is wrapped into a helper function,
<code>wand_helper</code>. Since the premise of the wand contains no
permissions for <code>t.priority</code>, we use a ghost variable
<code>root_prio</code> to communicate that value.</p>
<p>Applying the wand is nearly as simple as before. However, we again
need to use the ghost variable <code>root_prio</code> as an intermediate
storage for the priority of <code>t</code>.</p>
<p>You see that adding such additional constraints about the wand's
resources is possible, but can carry significant overhead of helper
functions, <code>use</code> statements, etc.</p>

<h1 id="what-does-this-vercors-error-message-mean">What does this
VerCors error message mean?</h1>
<p>This page is to explain what the different error messages in VerCors
mean. We try to keep this page alphabetically ordered by error message
(case insensitive sorting. For sentences: spaces come before letters in
the alphabet). If you have a question about error messages, please add a
question to this wiki page. If you know the answer to a question asked
here, please replace the question with the answer (or with a link to the
answer elsewhere on the wiki).</p>
<h4 id="assignmentfailed-insufficient-permission">AssignmentFailed:
insufficient permission</h4>
<p>This means you are trying to write to a variable (at the left hand
side of an assignment) to which VerCors cannot establish a
write-permission. The statement <code>assert(Perm(lhs,1));</code> in
which <code>lhs</code> is the left hand side of this assignment will
fail at this point in your code, but should be provable.</p>
<h4 id="illegal-argument-count">Illegal argument count</h4>
<p>This is a internal VerCors error, that might be due to a parse-error
in your script. We have opened a issue for this <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/issues/125">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="illegal-iteration-invariant">Illegal iteration invariant</h4>
<p>This seems to happen when you try to specify a
<code>loop_invariant</code> in a <code>for</code>-loop, where you're
using a resource as invariant. Try using <code>context</code> (short for
<code>ensures</code> and <code>requires</code> combined) instead. Are
you getting this message in a different situation? Do let us know!</p>
<h4 id="javalang">java.lang.*</h4>
<p>This is never supposed to happen, but unfortunately, it did. Thank
you for finding this bug in VerCors. Try searching our issue tracker to
see if you believe this bug is already being addressed. If not, please
let us know about it by adding it!</p>
<h4 id="no-viable-alternative-at-">No viable alternative at ...</h4>
<p>This is a parsing error, you may have made a typo, or inadvertently
used a reserved keyword as a variable. Check your code at the position
indicated. If this is the start of a line, make sure there is a
semicolon <code>;</code> at the previous line.</p>
<h4
id="notwellformedinsufficientpermission">NotWellFormed:InsufficientPermission</h4>
<p>This error is shown at a specification. We require rules to be 'self
framing', this means that you need read-permission in order to access
variables, even inside specifications. Furthermore, checks like array
accesses being within bounds need to hold. The order of the
specifications makes a difference here: the lines of your specifications
are checked from top to bottom, and from left to right. In order to
establish permissions and bounds, add a line of specification before the
line that gives you trouble, asserting that you have read permission, or
that the access is within bounds.</p>
<p>If you see this error in the <code>\old(..)</code> part of an ensures
expression, you need permission to that variable before executing the
function. For constructors (e.g. <code>foo</code> method of class
<code>foo</code>), there is no <code>\old(this.x)</code>, as the
variable <code>this.x</code> is only created when the constructor is
called.</p>
<h4
id="pre-condition-of-constructor-may-not-refer-to-this">Pre-condition of
constructor may not refer to this</h4>
<p>When calling the constructor method of a class, the class variables
are not yet initialised. Therefore, you should not refer to them. Do you
need write-permission? Don't worry, the class constructor already has it
by definition (as it implicitly creates the variables)! In particular,
use <code>ensures</code> instead of <code>context</code>.</p>
<h4 id="type-of-leftright-argument-is-resource-rather-than-boolean">Type
of left/right argument is Resource rather than Boolean:</h4>
<p>This is a type error. You are using a symbol like
<code>&amp;&amp;</code> that requires boolean values on both sides.
Changing <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to <code>**</code>, or breaking up your
specification into multiple lines might solve the problem for you.</p>

<h4
id="not-injective-or-resource-may-not-be-unique-with-regards-to-the-quantified-variables-or-similar">"Not
injective", or "resource may not be unique with regards to the
quantified variables", or similar</h4>
<p>Viper requires that all <code>forall</code> with permission
expressions (<code>forall*</code> in VerCors) are "injective". That
means that different values for the quantified variable(s) must result
in different memory locations in the permission expression. For example
in
<code>(\forall* int k; 0&lt;=k &amp;&amp; k&lt;arr.length; Perm(arr[k].myField, 1))</code>,
different <code>k</code> must point to different array elements, i.e.
<code>arr[i]</code> must be different from <code>arr[j]</code> if
<code>i!=j</code>. You need to add a condition like
<code>(\forall int i, int j; 0&lt;=i &amp;&amp; i&lt;j &amp;&amp; j&lt;arr.length; arr[i] != arr[j])</code>
before the quantifier that "may not be unique". And if
<code>myField</code> is an object, you might need to do the same for
<code>arr[i].myField</code> and <code>arr[j].myField</code>. More info

<h1 id="pvl-syntax-reference">PVL Syntax Reference</h1>
<p>On this page you can find a description of the specification language
of VerCors. In general, the specification language extends the language
that is verified, like Java. That means that all types, (pure)
operators, etc. from the source language can also be used in the
specifications, together with the specification-only constructs
described below.</p>
<p>Additionally, this page describes PVL, the Prototypal Verification
Language. It is a language similar to Java or C and can be verified like
them, so the same specification constructs are available. However, it is
developed specifically for VerCors, so we also provide the information
that is usually found in the language documentation, like the C
standard.</p>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Specifications are usually embedded in JML-like comments:
<code>/*@ spec @*/</code> or <code>//@ spec line</code>.
<strong>Exception</strong>: In PVL, specifications are
<strong>not</strong> embedded in comments, instead they are written into
the code directly.</p></li>
<li><p>In PVL, <strong>identifiers</strong> can consist of the
characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _. However, they must
<strong>start</strong> with an underscore or letter (a-z, A-Z).</p>
<p>In specifications, the same rules apply for identifiers as in the
language that is specified, e.g. Java identifiers in specifications of
Java.</p>
<p>Note that the following words are reserved and can therefore
<strong>not</strong> be used as identifiers: create, action, destroy,
send, recv, use, open, close, atomic, from, merge, split, process,
apply, label, \result, write, read, none, empty and current_thread.
However, keywords can be wrapped in backticks, to turn them into
identifiers, e.g. <code>create</code> cannot be used as an identifier,
but <code>`create`</code> is an identifier.</p></li>
<li><p>Most specification constructs are self-contained statements, like
preconditions, loop invariants or ghost assignments. Those end with a
semicolon <code>;</code>. However, a few elements, like
<code>with</code> side conditions, are parts of another statement, and
do not have their own semicolon.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pvl">PVL</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the top level of a program, there can be methods directly (like
in C). But more commonly, those are defined within a
<code>class</code>:</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<pre><code>class ClassName {
    // Here you can add any constructors, class variables and method declarations
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The keyword <code>this</code> is used to refer to the current
object, <code>null</code> for the null reference ("pointer to
nothing").</li>
<li>You can write single-line or multi-line comments as follows:</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<pre><code>// This is a single-line comment
/* 
    This is a 
    multi-line comment 
*/</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Like in C or Java, statements in PVL should end with a semi-colon
<code>;</code>.</li>
<li>For a more detailed description, see <a

<p>If you're doing a project with VerCors, ask us about the VerCors
community chat.</p>
<h2 id="getting-vercors-up-and-running">Getting VerCors up and
running</h2>
<p>Required: at least java 11</p>
<h3 id="pre-build">Pre-build</h3>
<ul>
<li>Download latest release (1.3.0 at the time of writing, doesn't work
on windows)</li>
<li>Download the build from the dev branch. Download the .tgz file, it
contains a bat script for windows as well. Very likely works, but no
guarantee</li>
</ul>
<p>Should be just unzip and go.</p>
<h3 id="compile-from-source">Compile from source</h3>
<p>Requires java 11 &amp; sbt. Benefits: allows setting breakpoints in
intellij. See VerCors README/Wiki for details.</p>
<h2 id="general-usage">General usage</h2>
<p><code>vercors inputFile.java --backend</code></p>
<p>Where <code>backend</code> can be either <code>silicon</code> or
<code>carbon</code>.</p>
<h2 id="general-flags">General flags</h2>
<p>Of course, <code>--help</code></p>
<p>Backends: <code>--carbon</code> (slower, but based on boogie, so
sometimes more powerful), <code>--silicon</code> (faster, built by ETH
Zurich, sometimes not as smart as Carbon)</p>
<p>Progress printing of individual passes: <code>--progress</code></p>
<p>Slows down execution but prints more debug info upon crashes:
<code>--debug vct.main.Main</code></p>
<p>Triggers a system notification upon completion:
<code>--notify</code></p>
<h2 id="advanced-verification-flags">Advanced verification flags</h2>
<h3 id="detection-of-unsound-preconditions">Detection of unsound
preconditions</h3>
<p>Flag: <code>--disable-sat</code></p>
<p>Turns off detection of unsound preconditions. Not needed in general
use of VerCors. Might be necessary if you have a lot of foralls in
preconditions, and verification is slow.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-flags">Debugging flags</h2>
<p>Flags: <code>--show-before passName</code>,
<code>--show-after passName</code></p>
<p>Show textual representation of internal AST before and after a pass.
Pass names can be seen by running VerCors with
<code>--progress</code>.</p>
<h3 id="vscode-plugin--flags-needed">VSCode plugin + flags needed</h3>
<p>Dump AST given to silicon/carbon into a text file:
<code>--encoded temp.sil</code></p>
<p>This can be opened in VScode with the ETH Zurich Viper
plugin/extension installed (see the vscode store for this).</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The viper version between VerCors and vscode might be out of
sync</li>

<h1 id="developing-for-vercors">Developing for VerCors</h1>
<p>In Summer 2024, Pieter wrote this developer's guide on the internals
of VerCors: <a
href="https://pieter-bos.github.io/vercors-doc/">https://pieter-bos.github.io/vercors-doc/</a>.
It provides some useful background on the setup of the project, and how
to do certain tasks.</p>
<h2 id="prbranch-management">PR/Branch management</h2>
<p>Some general guidelines/notes to take into account when developing
for VerCors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draft PRs:</strong> while a PR is unfinished, mark it as
"draft". Once it is ready for merging, unmark it as draft. Please do
this even for short-lived PRs, so there is a definitive signal that work
on a PR has finished.</li>
<li><strong>Branches &amp; PRs:</strong> if you do work on a branch, it
<strong>must</strong> have a PR. This way we keep track of what everyone
is working on.</li>
<li><strong>PR size:</strong> try to keep your PRs small. If it has been
open for longer than a month, consider bringing the PR in a state where
it can be merged, even though your work might not be finished yet. This
ensures we can still try to do bigger refactorings, while keeping churn
in long-standing branches minimal.</li>
<li><strong>Branch naming:</strong> we don't really have a guideline for
this, proposals welcome. For now: if it's for a specific subsystem
(VeyMont, VeSUV, Pallas), include that. If relevant, feel free to
include the issue number.</li>
<li><strong>VerCors repo or fork:</strong> obviously, you may open PRs
that propose to merge a branch from a VerCors fork. We try to support
this workflow in our CI, as long as it doesn't take too much effort. If
you're a UT student, FMT employee, or research collaborator, get in
touch with us so you can do your development directly in the VerCors
repo, if you prefer.</li>
<li><strong>Branch cleanup:</strong> delete your branch after its PR has
been merged, unless you plan on continuing development on it. Don't
leave it lying around unused.</li>
<li><strong>Quality control:</strong> on the dev &amp; master branch,
all tests (except flaky ones) should pass, and all files should be
formatted using the auto formatter. On your own branch you can pretty
much do whatever you want.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-workflow">Example workflow</h2>
<p><em>Below you can find a description of what a typical workflow looks
like.</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Determine what you want to fix.</li>
<li>If there is an issue for what you want to fix, assign yourself to
the issue. This can be done by navigating to the specific page of the
issue. Then on the right-hand side there is an "Assignees" header.
Beneath this header click on "assign yourself".</li>
<li>Ask for permissions to push to the main VerCors repository. We
prefer to keep an eye on evolving development by asking contributors to
work in branches of the main repository. Alternatively, you can work in
your own fork (but e.g. continuous integration will not work).</li>
<li>Navigate to the VerCors project on your computer in your
terminal.</li>
<li>When you're inside the <code>vercors</code> directory, create a new
branch by executing the following command:
<code>git branch branch_name</code>. Replace <code>branch_name</code> by
the name for your branch. This name can reflect what you will fix. For
example if you are going to fix issue 1, then you can name the branch
"issue1". Or if you add support for automatic generation of invariants,
then you can name the branch "automaticInvariants".</li>
<li>Then switch to the new branch using the command
<code>git checkout branch_name</code>.</li>
<li>You can now start working on your problem!</li>
<li>When you are done with your fix, <strong>commit and push</strong>
your changed files to the branch. To push to your new branch you can use
the following command:<code>git push origin branch_name</code>.</li>
<li>Navigate to the main GitHub page of VerCors (<a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/">https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/</a>).</li>
<li>Create a new pull request (see also: <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/">https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/</a>).</li>
<li>GitHub will run the tests, check that there are no unresolved
comments on the pull request, and verify the tests have run with the
most recent upstream changes.</li>
<li>As soon as this pull request has been reviewed by at least one
person, and is accepted, then your fix can be merged into the master
branch. <em>Congratulations you're done with this PR (Pull
Request)!</em></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h1>
<h2 id="functional-overview">Functional Overview</h2>
<p>VerCors verifies programs by going through four stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The frontend, or parsing</strong>: in this step a collection
of files is read and parsed into COL, the common object language. This
is the internal intermediate representation of programs in VerCors.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: here we figure out what names in the
AST mean. Every name must point to (part of) a declaration. Afterwards,
we forget about the name and only remember a pointer to the relevant
declaration.</li>
<li><strong>The rewrite stage</strong>: The COL AST (usually referred to
as just the AST) is transformed into a different AST, or it is checked
for some property, together called a "pass". Depending on user-supplied
options many passes are applied to the AST. They can be divided in
several categories:
<ul>
<li><em>Reducing a feature</em>: The subset of COL used is reduced, by
encoding the proof obligations of a language construct in some other
way. An example is that we reduce <code>for</code> loops to
<code>while</code> loops, by placing the initialization before a new
while loop, retaining the condition, and appending the update to the end
of the loop body.</li>
<li><em>Checking for consistency</em>: in some places it is useful that
the type structure of the AST is not as strict as the set of ASTs we
want to allow. Almost all checks are done in the type check, a single
pass executed many times.</li>
<li><em>Standardization</em>: many passes expect certain properties to
be true about the AST (e.g. "expresions have no side effects"), but on
the other hand it is useful not to constrain passes too much in what
they can generate. Therefor we standardize the AST between passes, to
reduce simple language features.</li>
<li><em>Importing builtins</em>: some features are supported by
importing a header of sorts into the AST.</li>
<li><em>Optimization</em>: optimizing passes transform the AST (in
particular expressions) such that they are faster to prove, or rely less
on heuristics of the backend.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The backend, or verification</strong>: the very much reduced
AST is transformed once more, into the language of the selected backend.
The backend makes a judgement on the program. This judgement is
translated back into useful information about the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a few cross-cutting concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The origin system</strong> tracks how the frontend parse
tree is transformed via COL into a backend language. This means that if
a message from the backend mentions a part of the AST in the backend
language, it can be translated all the way back to its origin in the
frontend input.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-setup">Technical Setup</h2>
<p>The VerCors project sources are managed on GitHub, at <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors">https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors</a>.
The unstable development branch is <code>dev</code>, from where we
branch to develop new features and bugfixes. Those with access may push
feature branches to the main repository, or create a fork if they
prefer. A pull request is then made and reviewed by someone
appropriate.</p>
<p>Pushed commits as well as pull requests are checked via continuous
integration, currently Github Actions. Github builds Vercors and runs
the test suite. Once the checks pas and a code review is completed, the
PR is merged in dev. In dev is also where we hope to notice bad
interactions between new features.</p>
<p>We aim to make a new VerCors release once per month, which is done
via a tagged merge commit to the <code>master</code> branch, followed by
a GitHub release.</p>
<p>VerCors is written in java and scala. Code is accepted in either
language, but we encourage you to take the time to learn some Scala - it
is much better suited to manipulating ASTs. The build structure is
defined in the mill build tool.</p>

<p>This directory serves the dual purpose of being an archive of past
case studies and competition results, as well as the test suite of
VerCors. Files in this directory have a header denoting how they are
used in the test suite. Names denoted by "case" or "cases" are
collected, where overlapping names are joined together as one test case.
Files may occur in more than one "case." "tools" denotes the backend
used (silicon by default), "verdict" the expected final result (Pass by
default).</p>

<h1 id="ide-import">IDE Import</h1>
<p>This document gives instructions on how to configure a development
environment for VerCors, using either <strong><a
href="#intellij-idea">⌄Intellij IDEA</a></strong> or <strong><a
href="#vscode">⌄Visual Studio Code</a></strong>. Most VerCors developers
use Intellij IDEA. Although VerCors supports Windows, MacOs and other
unixen, most developers use a Linux distribution, so the development
experience is tested more thoroughly on Linux.</p>
<h2 id="basic-setup">Basic setup</h2>
<p>This section describes how to install the prerequisites in more

<p>Install the Scala plugin, e.g. from the splash screen:</p>
<p><img

alt="image" /></p>
<p>Open or import the VerCors project from the root of the repository
(i.e. the <code>vercors</code> directory).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have not yet compiled VerCors at this point, importing may
take approximately 5 minutes. It is also possible that importing fails
with an error. In that case, let the synchronization finish fully, then
go to <code>Build &gt; Reload BSP project</code> (the ⟲ symbol).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: VerCors requires more stack memory than
normal applications. It is recommended to increase it before adding any
configurations</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to
<code>Run &gt; Edit Configurations &gt; Edit Configuration Templates</code></li>
<li>Edit the <code>Application</code> template</li>
<li>Go to <code>Modidify options &gt; Add VM options</code></li>
<li>Enter <code>-Xss20m</code> in the <code>VM options</code> field</li>
<li>Edit the <code>ScalaTest</code> template</li>
<li>Enter <code>-Xss20m</code> in the <code>VM options</code> field</li>
</ul>
<p>Set the JDK to version 17 or later in
<code>File &gt; Project Structure &gt; Project Settings &gt; Project &gt; SDK</code>.</p>
<h3 id="running-and-debugging-vercors">Running and Debugging
VerCors</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to <code>Run &gt; Edit Configurations</code> and add an
<code>Application</code> configuration</li>
<li>Set the classpath <code>-cp</code> to <code>vercors</code></li>
<li>Set the <code>Main class</code> to <code>vct.main.Main</code> (and
not <code>vct.main.Main$</code>)</li>
<li>If IntelliJ complains that it cannot find
<code>BuildInfo.buildinfo.properties</code>, you may have to go to
<code>Modify Options &gt; Add before launch task</code> and activate
<code>Use BSP Environment</code>. In the pop-up, you can just click
<code>ok</code> (the target can be blank or filled, doesn't
matter).</li>
<li>Specifically for the IntelliJ Console you need to force enable
progress messages with the program argument <code>-p</code></li>
<li>You can be asked to specify a file every time by adding
<code>$Prompt$</code> to the program arguments, or just append a file
path relative to the <code>vercors</code> root directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end your configuration should look something like this:</p>
<p><img

alt="image" /></p>
<h3 id="running-the-test-suite">Running the test suite</h3>
<p>The test suite takes approximately 45 minutes to run on a modern
machine. You may wish to push your changes to your branch at the main
repository instead, so that the CI can run chunks of the test suite in
parallel. This currently takes approximately 15 minutes instead.</p>
<p>You can create a <code>ScalaTest</code> run configuration
automatically by right-clicking a directory or file containing tests,
and then clicking
<code>Run 'ScalaTests in &lt;directory or file&gt;'</code>. We currently
do not have a way of running a single test in a file that contains
multiple tests from within IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
<h3 id="unclear-build-errors">Unclear build errors</h3>
<p>If the build error is not clear, it may be helpful to run mill
directly from a terminal, e.g.:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb72"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb72-1"><a href="#cb72-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">./mill</span> <span class="at">-j</span> 0 vercors.compile</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="running-the-intellij-build-from-a-terminal">Running the IntelliJ
build from a terminal</h3>
<p>IntelliJ communicates with the mill build system to build VerCors.
The scripts at <code>./bin/vct</code> and <code>bin\vct.cmd</code> will
ask mill how to run VerCors. Consequently, you can always run the most
recent VerCors build from a terminal with this script.</p>

<p>Install the Metals plugin by going to
<code>Ctrl+Shift+X &gt; Scala (Metals) &gt; Install</code></p>
<p><img

alt="image" /></p>
<p>This will add a Metals symbol in the left tray.</p>
<p>Open the VerCors project from the root of the repository (i.e. the
<code>vercors</code> directory) at <code>File &gt; Open Folder</code>.
When prompted by the Metals extension, click
<code>Import build</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you hid the notification, it may be in your notifications on the
bottom right. Alternatively you can click <code>Import build</code> from

<h3 id="running-the-test-suite-1">Running the test suite</h3>
<p>The test suite takes approximately 45 minutes to run on a modern
machine. You may wish to push your changes to your branch at the main
repository instead, so that the CI can run chunks of the test suite in
parallel. This currently takes approximately 15 minutes instead.</p>
<p>You can simply run tests yourself from the Test pane on the left (the
⚗ symbol).</p>
<h3 id="running-the-metals-build-from-a-terminal">Running the Metals
build from a terminal</h3>
<p>VSCode communicates with the mill build system to build VerCors. The
scripts at <code>./bin/vct</code> and <code>bin\vct.cmd</code> will ask
mill how to run VerCors. Consequently, you can always run the most
recent VerCors build from a terminal with this script.</p>
<h1 id="scalatest">ScalaTest</h1>
<h2 id="running-scalatest">Running ScalaTest</h2>
<p>ScalaTest can be run by the commandline or via the Intellij. For
running with Intellij you need the Scala plugin of JetBrains. VerCors
uses a lot of memory that is why you have to add an VM option to the
ScalaTest template. Go to Run/Debug Configuration. Click on the blue
text "Edit configuration templates..." in the left corner. Select
ScalaTest. Select Configuration. Set VM options to "-Xss128M". You can
run the test by right clicking a test file and selecting the option "Run
'{filename}'". To run a single test you can open the file and clicking
on the run arrow between the line number and the text of the file. The
test files are in "src/test/scala/". Intellij also supports running the
test in debug mode by selecting debug mode. Running from the commandline
can be done using sbt. The following command runs all the tests.
<code>sbt test</code> The following command runs all the test in the
file integration.Generated1Tests.
<code>sbt "testOnly integration.Generated1Tests"</code></p>
<p>More settings can be found in <a
href="https://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_scalatest_with_sbt">https://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_scalatest_with_sbt</a>
Note that the run settings like classpath and available memory can be
different from Intellij and sbt.</p>
<h1 id="profiling">Profiling</h1>
<p>VerCors can generate a profile in the <a
href="https://github.com/google/pprof">pprof</a> format. This only works
on unix-like systems, and works best on linux. The file
<code>profile.pprof.gz</code> is generated in the current directory when
passing the flag <code>--profile</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb75"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb75-1"><a href="#cb75-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> vercors <span class="at">--profile</span> some/example.java</span>
<span id="cb75-2"><a href="#cb75-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">(</span><span class="ex">...</span><span class="kw">)</span></span>
<span id="cb75-3"><a href="#cb75-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> ls profile.pprof.gz</span>
<span id="cb75-4"><a href="#cb75-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">profile.pprof.gz</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>It's safe to stop vercors with control-C (<code>SIGINT</code>), and
the profile will contain all samples up to that point, with the
exception of <code>childSys</code> and <code>childUser</code> (explained
below).</p>
<p>It can be viewed with e.g. the <a
href="https://github.com/google/pprof">pprof tool</a>, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>$ pprof -http=:1234 profile.pprof.gz</code></pre>
<p><img

alt="image" /></p>
<h3 id="samples">Samples</h3>
<p>The profile contains several different samples, listed under
"Sample":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>wall</strong>: The amount of real time a task took (as
though you looked at a clock on the wall). Under parallelism this
measurement does not aggregate nicely</li>
<li><strong>(...)User</strong>: The amount of time spent on the CPU.
Under parallelism the time is summed up, i.e. it can go considerably
faster that wall time.</li>
<li><strong>(...)Sys</strong>: The amount of time spent in the kernel,
as requested by the process. Indicative of file i/o etc.</li>
<li><strong>child(...)</strong>: Measures the time spent in child
processes. For VerCors this is strictly the SMT backend, usually z3. It
is only populated once an entire child process has completed, hence in
practice the entire z3 time is accounted under "Verification" without
further specifying.</li>
<li><strong>self(...)</strong>: Measures the time spent in our own
process, excluding any child processes</li>
<li><strong>agg(...)</strong>: aggregate of child and self usage.</li>
<li><strong>agg</strong>: all child and self usage, both system time and
user time, all summed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="measuring-for-publication">Measuring for publication</h3>
<p>Use <code>aggUser</code> as a stable measurement for the amount of
computation VerCors has done: it represents the total amount of
computation time VerCors has used.</p>
<h3 id="diagnosing-slow-proof-goals">Diagnosing slow proof goals</h3>
<p><code>View &gt; Flame Graph</code> is most useful for this. You can
use <code>selfUser</code> to diagnose cases where silicon itself
(without z3) is slow. <code>wall</code> is most useful when including
<code>z3</code>, since unfortunately <code>childUser</code> cannot track
the individual usage by verifier or goal.</p>
<p>The width of bars in the flame graph represent the amount of time
spent on them. Click on a bar to zoom into it horizontally, click on
bars above the focused bar to zoom out again.</p>
<p>In silicon we try to compute a hierarchy, trying to obtain in
order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entity being verified (method, function, predicate)</li>
<li>Then the statement being executed</li>
<li>Then the assertion being in- or exhaled</li>
<li>Then the branch conditions under which we are dealing with the
assertion</li>
</ul>
<p>We also include some "comment" records, indicated with
<code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.</p>
<h1 id="wiki-code-snippet-testing-harness">Wiki Code Snippet Testing

<p>VerCors supports extracting tests from the tutorial and automatically
running the extracted tests. The following syntax is recognized in the
tutorial. For example usages of this syntax, see the raw version of the
chapter of <a

<p>There are three possible code block annotations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>testBlock</code> wraps the code in a method and class</li>
<li><code>testMethod</code> wraps the code in a class</li>
<li><code>test</code> returns the code as is</li>
</ul>
<p><code>testBlock</code> and <code>testMethod</code> are compatible
with Java and PVL.</p>
<p>The case name of the generated test is derived from the heading

enclosed in triple back-ticks like any displayed code block.</p>
<h1 id="parser-analysis">Parser Analysis</h1>
<p>Over time it's been noticed that there are two large issues with the
parsing stage across multiple input languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsing is slow for certain languages</li>
<li>Memory usage can be extreme due to <code>_sharedContextCache</code>
being a shared static field in each parser</li>
</ul>
<p>We've long suspected that both could be fixed by making the grammar
more straightforward to parse, but so far we haven't conclusively found
what we should change. There are now a couple flags that analyze what is
happening during parsing to help with that. I've tried to add (in an
overly confident tone) what ANTLR is now reporting to us. I'm pretty
sure there are holes in my understanding of ANTLR still, so apologies in
advance.</p>
<h3 id="flags-to-analyse-antlr">Flags to analyse ANTLR</h3>
<p>You can pass <code>--dev-parsing-ambiguities</code> and
<code>--dev-parsing-sensitivities</code>. ANTLR only cares about
ambiguities in the sense that it has to tell you for each rule which
alternative it chose. A decision is considered context-sensitive when we
cannot decide with one token of lookahead what alternative to choose.
While matching a production like
<code>(expr expr)* expr expr expr</code> we do need more lookahead than
one, because it is not clear while reading expressions whether to
continue in the <code>*</code> or read the last three expressions.
Nevertheless this is not context-sensitive, because ANTLR dumps all
terminals/non-terminals flatly into the context that represents the
current production, so even in the face of a context-sensitive decision
like this, the resulting data structure is the same anyway.</p>
<h3 id="format-of-the-output">Format of the output</h3>
<p>When enabling either flag you will receive outputs like this:</p>
<pre><code>======================================

Prediction of rule theTypeName required full context and took 0.00s:
[x] simpleTemplateId
 &gt;  className
 &gt;  enumName
 &gt;  typedefName
======================================</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The start of the indicated region is the position at which a
context-sensitivity was detected</li>
<li>The end of the region indicates when we have returned to normalcy,
and we know which alternative to choose</li>
<li>The message indicates the name of the rule where an ambiguity
occurred, and how much time it took to run the analysis (this does not
seem to be indicative of anything yet)</li>
<li>The bottom lists the productions for the given rule, potentially
prefixed by an indicator</li>
<li>An indicator of <code>&gt;</code> indicates a definitively viable
alternative</li>
<li>An indicator of <code>[x]</code> indicates an alternative that was
discarded only <em>after</em> running a full-context analysis</li>
<li>No indicator means it was not considered a viable alternative, even
before considering context. (There are no lines without an indicator in
this example)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: if there are multiple <code>&gt;</code>
lines, this means that there is an <strong>ambiguity</strong> in the
parser: both are valid. If there is only one <code>&gt;</code>, there
must be a <code>[x]</code>: it means the grammar is <strong>sensitive to
context</strong>. I think that context-sensitivities can be normal/fine
if the indicated region is quite small.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: The name of the rule refers to the rule in
the input grammar. In the case of left-recursive grammars (e.g. most of
our expressions), the grammar is instead rewritten, so you may see
alternatives that do not make much sense, like this:</p>

======================================</code></pre>
<p>Note that the first alternative ends in <code>+</code>. This language
represents the tail part of the left-recursive alternatives of
<code>expr</code>. The operator precedence is here already encoded by
antlr automatically through semantic predicates
<code>{_ &gt;= _p}?</code>, I don't know the exact mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>Note 3</strong>: Note that the alternatives are recovered
from the augmented transition network in the parser, and then
pretty-printed as a production rule. This means that they may not
exactly correspond to the input, even when not left-recursive.
Especially note that a rule such as <code>(a | b?)</code> is
pretty-printed as <code>(a | b)?</code>, which is equivalent (!)</p>
<h3 id="now-what">Now what</h3>
<p>I'm not certain what you should actually change when something is
reported. Nevertheless I offer some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think ambiguities are universally bad: an input should really have
at most one derivation. It can be indicative of duplicate rules.</li>
<li>Maybe we should try doing stuff like
<code>exp2: exp1 (('*'|'/') exp1)*</code> instead of
<code>exp2: exp1 | exp2 '*' exp1 | exp2 '/' exp1</code></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="git-hooks">Git Hooks</h1>
<p>For a general explanation on git hooks see <a
href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks">here</a>.</p>
<p>We use git hooks for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To self-install any updates to the git hooks</li>
<li>To format files that are changed in a commit along the scalafmt
rules.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="updating-or-installing-git-hooks">Updating or installing git
hooks</h2>
<p>You can install the git hooks for this repository with
<code>./util/gitconfig.sh</code> in a terminal or Git Bash. This causes
the scripts in <code>util/githooks</code> to be run at the listed event.
Currenty only <code>pre-commit</code> does anything interesting.</p>
<h2 id="formatting-files">Formatting files</h2>
<p>It's polite not to introduce formatting changes in commits - this
keeps diffs nice to read. For that reason we run formatting
automatically on the list of files that is changed in a commit just
before actually doing the commit. Please do not manually run formatting
on files that are not touched by your commit.</p>
<p>If something goes wrong: we do not assign much priority to the
formatting being correct, so when in doubt we do not mind commits with
<code>--no-verify</code>.</p>

<h1 id="making-a-new-vercors-release">Making a new VerCors release</h1>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Add an auto-generated release to the github
repo</strong></p>
<p>This is managed by the <a
href="https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/blob/dev/.github/workflows/release.yml"><code>release</code></a>
workflow. It is executed for any commit tagged with a version. So pick
the commit you want to make a release for, tag it, and let the workflow
run.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add a changelog to the release</strong></p>
<p>Open the release, click the "edit" button of the release, and click
the "Generate release notes" button at the top. Take case that the
proper "Previous tag" is set, to make sure only commits are included in
the release notes that are actually in the release. Do a brief
readthrough and expand or delete text where necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upload a docker image</strong></p>
<p>Build a docker image locally of the commit that you just tagged with
the new version. This is done using the <code>docker</code> target the
build system. Push that to one of the following docker registries. Also
update the <code>latest</code> tag in the respective registry.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The container registry in a VerCors repo located on the University
of Twente gitlab. (At the time of writing, this repo does not yet exist.
E.g. <a
href="https://gitlab.utwente.nl/fmt/vercors/vercors-back-up/container_registry">https://gitlab.utwente.nl/fmt/vercors/vercors-back-up/container_registry</a>)</li>
<li><a
href="https://hub.docker.com/r/utwentefmt/vercors/tags">https://hub.docker.com/r/utwentefmt/vercors/tags</a></li>
</ol>
<p>We don't have a policy for which registry to use. Historically
speaking, we've been using dockerhub because it's standard and there's a
utwente-fmt organization. Probably in the long term we should move to
the UT gitlab.</p>
<p>We should also consider using the UT harbor (<a
href="http://harbor.utsp.utwente.nl">http://harbor.utsp.utwente.nl</a>)
for compliance/vulnerability checking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add an announcement</strong></p>
<p>If it is a major version release or a big point release you can
consider adding an announcement on the VerCors website or FMT
website.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Done!</p>
