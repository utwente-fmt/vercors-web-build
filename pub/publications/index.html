This case study is an ongoing project; we describe our experience on the team's learning curve for this experiment and present the preliminary conclusions on the case study.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-61467-6\",\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61467-6_18}\n}\n\n\n","author_short":["Huisman, M.","Monti, R.

To provide these services, efficient software plays an important role. Concurrent programming is a technique that developers can exploit to gain more performance. In a concurrent program several threads of execution simultaneously are being executed. Sometimes they have to compete to access shared resources, like memory. This race of accessing shared memories can cause unexpected errors. Programmers use synchronisation constructs to tame the concurrency and control the accesses. In order to develop reliable concurrent software, the correctness of these synchronisation constructs is crucial.In this thesis we use a program logic, called permission-based Separation Logic, to statically reason about the correctness of synchronisation constructs. The logic has the power to reason about correct ownership of threads regarding shared memory. A correctly functioning synchroniser is responsible for exchanging a correct permission when a thread requests access to the shared memory. We use our VERCORS verification tool-set to verify the correctness of various synchronisation constructs.In Chapter 1 we discuss the scope of the thesis. All the required technical background about permission-based Separation Logic and synchronisation classes is explained in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 we discuss how threads' start and join as minimum synchronisation points can be verified. To verify correctness of the synchronisation classes we have to first specify expected behaviour of the classes. This is covered in Chapter 4. In this chapter we present a unified approach to abstractly describe the common behaviour of synchronisers. Using our specifications, one is able to reason about the correctness of the client programs that access the shared state through the synchronisers.The atomic classes of java.util.concurrent are the core element of every synchronisation construct implementation. In Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 we propose a specification for atomic classes. Using this contract, we verified the implementation of synchronisation constructs w.r.t to their specifications from Chapter 4. In our proposed contract the specification of the atomic classes is parameterized with the protocols and resource invariants. Based on the context, the parameters can be defined. In Chapter 7 we propose a verification stack where each layer of stack verifies one particular aspect of a specified concurrent program in which atomic operations are the main synchronisation constructs. We demonstrate how to verify that a non-blocking data structure is data-race free and well connected. Based on the result of the verification from the lower layers, upper layers can reason about the functional properties of the concurrent data structure.In Chapter 8 we present a sound specification and verification technique to reason about data race freedom and functional correctness of GPU kernels that use atomic operations as synchronisation mechanism.Finally, Chapter 9 concludes the thesis with future directions.","author":[{"firstnames":["A."],"propositions":[],"lastnames":["Amighi"],"suffixes":[]}],"note":"CTIT Ph.D. thesis series No. 17-451 IPA dissertation series No. 2018-01","year":"2018","month":"1","day":"17","doi":"10.3990/1.9789036544399","language":"English","isbn":"978-90-365-4439-9","publisher":"University of Twente","address":"Netherlands","school":"University of Twente","url":"https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/specification-and-verification-of-synchronisation-classes-in-java","bibtex":"@phdthesis{7077aace92e5428aaa370770a09e2b7a,\n    title       = \"Specification and verification of synchronisation classes in Java: A practical approach\",\n    abstract    = \"Digital services are becoming an essential part of our daily lives.

Based on the result of the verification from the lower layers, upper layers can reason about the functional properties of the concurrent data structure.In Chapter 8 we present a sound specification and verification technique to reason about data race freedom and functional correctness of GPU kernels that use atomic operations as synchronisation mechanism.Finally, Chapter 9 concludes the thesis with future directions.\",\n    author      = \"A.

abstract = &quot;Sorting is one of the fundamental operations in computer science, and many sequential and parallel algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Swap-based sorting algorithms are one category of sorting algorithms where elements are swapped repeatedly to achieve the desired order. Since these algorithms are widely used in practice, their (functional) correctness, i.e., proving sortedness and permutation properties, is of utmost importance. However, proving the permutation property using automated program verifiers is much more challenging as the formal definition of this property involves existential quantifiers. In this paper, we propose a generic pattern to verify the permutation property for any sequential and parallel swap-based sorting algorithm automatically. To demonstrate our approach, we use VerCors, a verification tool based on separation logic for concurrent and parallel programs, to verify the permutation property of bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, parallel odd-even transposition sort, quick sort, two in-place merge sorts and TimSort for any arbitrary size of input.&quot;,

However, hardly any studies are conducted to determine whether the actual problems developers encounter are sufficiently addressed. For the relatively young field of GPU programming, we would like to know whether the tools developed so far are sufficient, or whether some problems still need attention.

We think many problems are already properly addressed, but there is still a need for easy to use sound tools.

abstract = &quot;Over the last years, we have seen tremendous progress in the area of deductive program verification. To demonstrate this progress, and to bring the area of deductive program verification even further, we have proposed the VerifyThis Collaborative Long Term Challenge, which calls upon the program verification community to verify different aspects of a realistic software application over a period of several months. Goal of the challenge is to foster collaboration in order to verify a realistic and industrially-relevant software application. This paper outlines the considerations that we made when selecting the challenge, and discusses how we believe it will encourage collaboration. It presents the software application that was selected for the challenge in 2019–2020, discusses the practical set up of the challenge, and briefly reports on the received solutions and an online workshop where the different solutions were presented.&quot;,

In this paper we investigate performance bottlenecks in the VerCors program verifier. Moreover, we also discuss two solutions to the identified performance bottlenecks: an improved encoding of arrays, as well as a technique to automatically generate trigger expressions to guide the underlying prover when reasoning about quantifiers. For both solutions we measure the effect on the performance. We see that the new encoding vastly reduces the verification time of certain programs, while other programs keep showing comparable times.

abstract = &quot;Deductive software verification aims at formally verifying that all possible behaviors of a given program satisfy formally defined, possibly complex properties, where the verification process is based on logical inference.

  Deductive software verification aims at formally verifying that all possible behaviors of a given program satisfy formally defined, possibly complex properties, where the verification process is based on logical inference. We follow the trajectory of the field from its inception in the late 1960s via its current state to its promises for the future, from pen-and-paper proofs for programs written in small, idealized languages to highly automated proofs of complex library or system code written in mainstream languages. We take stock of the state-of-art and give a list of the most important challenges for the further development of the field of deductive software verification.

This verification has been performed using VerCors. We also demonstrate how our mechanized correctness proof allows verifying various optimisations of parallel NDFS with only little extra effort.The second part contributes an abstraction technique for verifying global behavioural properties of shared-memory concurrent software. This abstraction technique allows specifying program behavior as a process-algebraic model, with an elegant algebraic structure. Furthermore, we extend CSL with logical primitives that allow one to prove that a program refines its process-algebraic specification. This abstraction technique is proven sound using Coq and is implemented in VerCors. We demonstrate our approach on various examples, including a real-world case study from industry that concerns safety-critical code.In part three, we lift our abstraction technique to the distributed case, by adapting it for verifying message passing concurrent software. This adaptation uses process-algebraic specifications to abstract the communication behavior of distributed agents. We also investigate how model checking of these specifications can soundly be combined with the deductive verification of the specified program.&quot;,

the VerCors verification tool for concurrent programs. The aim is to identify
the cause of a performance bottleneck, in order to optimize the tool.
We introduce a technique to identify what properties of a program are more
difficult to verify. Using those results, we present solutions to two performance
bottlenecks that were identified: 1. An alternative encoding of arrays is implemented
in the tool which allows the tool to reason up to 4 times faster about
programs that make use of arrays. 2. Our research in generating triggers for
quantified expressions show that speedups up to 30% are possible. Though further
research is required to investigate if this solution can be generalized and
optimized further.}

    abstract    = &quot;Digital services are becoming an essential part of our daily lives. To provide these services, efficient software plays an important role. Concurrent programming is a technique that developers can exploit to gain more performance. In a concurrent program several threads of execution simultaneously are being executed. Sometimes they have to compete to access shared resources, like memory. This race of accessing shared memories can cause unexpected errors. Programmers use synchronisation constructs to tame the concurrency and control the accesses. In order to develop reliable concurrent software, the correctness of these synchronisation constructs is crucial.In this thesis we use a program logic, called permission-based Separation Logic, to statically reason about the correctness of synchronisation constructs. The logic has the power to reason about correct ownership of threads regarding shared memory. A correctly functioning synchroniser is responsible for exchanging a correct permission when a thread requests access to the shared memory. We use our VERCORS verification tool-set to verify the correctness of various synchronisation constructs.In Chapter 1 we discuss the scope of the thesis. All the required technical background about permission-based Separation Logic and synchronisation classes is explained in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 we discuss how threads&#x27; start and join as minimum synchronisation points can be verified. To verify correctness of the synchronisation classes we have to first specify expected behaviour of the classes. This is covered in Chapter 4. In this chapter we present a unified approach to abstractly describe the common behaviour of synchronisers. Using our specifications, one is able to reason about the correctness of the client programs that access the shared state through the synchronisers.The atomic classes of java.util.concurrent are the core element of every synchronisation construct implementation. In Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 we propose a specification for atomic classes. Using this contract, we verified the implementation of synchronisation constructs w.r.t to their specifications from Chapter 4. In our proposed contract the specification of the atomic classes is parameterized with the protocols and resource invariants. Based on the context, the parameters can be defined. In Chapter 7 we propose a verification stack where each layer of stack verifies one particular aspect of a specified concurrent program in which atomic operations are the main synchronisation constructs. We demonstrate how to verify that a non-blocking data structure is data-race free and well connected. Based on the result of the verification from the lower layers, upper layers can reason about the functional properties of the concurrent data structure.In Chapter 8 we present a sound specification and verification technique to reason about data race freedom and functional correctness of GPU kernels that use atomic operations as synchronisation mechanism.Finally, Chapter 9 concludes the thesis with future directions.&quot;,

Active Object are not a build-in feature of the Java programming language. For asynchronous method calls, we used the Java Future interface to return result values. We created a formal specification for the Java Future interface and proved a simple implementation correct using the VerCors tool set.
We implemented the communication to Active Objects using message passing with the MPJ Express library. To verify this implementation, the message passing library has been annotated and a definition of valid messages in this program is given. We also annotated our implementation, however we encountered problems annotating the returning of result values. The annotations require a lot of administrative overhead and are hard to get correct. 
Also the existing VerCors tool set is not capable yet to automatically verify the program, mainly because it lacks support for output parameters or sum notation in the process algebra for futures.}
