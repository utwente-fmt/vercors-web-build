title = "HaliVer: Deductive Verification and Scheduling Languages Join Forces",
abstract = "The HALIVER tool integrates deductive verification into the popular scheduling language HALIDE, used for image processing pipelines and array computations. HALIVER uses VERCORS, a separation logic-based verifier, to verify the correctness of (1) the HALIDE algorithms and (2) the optimised parallel code produced by HALIDE when an optimisation schedule is applied to an algorithm. This allows proving complex, optimised code correct while reducing the effort to provide the required verification annotations. For both approaches, the same specification is used. We evaluated the tool on several optimised programs generated from characteristic HALIDE algorithms, using all but one of the essential scheduling directives available in HALIDE. Without annotation effort, HALIVER proves memory safety in almost all programs. With annotations HALIVER, additionally, proves functional correctness properties. We show that the approach is viable and reduces the manual annotation effort by an order of magnitude.",

title = "First Steps towards Deductive Verification of LLVM IR",
abstract = "Over the last years, deductive program verifiers have substantially improved, and their applicability on non-trivial applications has been demonstrated. However, a major bottleneck is that for every new programming language, a new deductive verifier has to be built.This paper describes the first steps in a project that aims to address this problem, by language-agnostic support for deductive verification: Rather than building a deductive program verifier for every programming language, we develop deductive program verification technology for a widely-used intermediate representation language (LLVM IR), such that we eventually get verification support for any language that can be compiled into the LLVM IR format.Concretely, this paper describes the design of VCLLVM, a prototype tool that adds LLVM IR as a supported language to the VerCors verifier. We discuss the challenges that have to be addressed to develop verification support for such a low-level language. Moreover, we also sketch how we envisage to build verification support for any specified source program that can be compiled into LLVM IR on top of VCLLVM.",

abstract="Major strengths of deductive verification include modular verification and support for functional properties and unbounded parameters. However, in embedded systems, crucial safety properties often depend on concurrent process interactions, events, and time. Such properties are global in nature and thus difficult to verify in a modular fashion. Furthermore, the execution and scheduling semantics of industrially used embedded system design languages such as SystemC are typically only informally defined. In this paper, we propose a deductive verification approach for embedded systems that are modeled with SystemC. Our main contribution is twofold: 1) We provide a formal encoding and an automated transformation of SystemC designs for verification with the VerCors deductive verifier. 2) We present a novel approach for invariant construction to abstractly capture global dependencies. Our encoding enables an automated formalization and deductive verification of parameterized SystemC designs, and the invariant construction enables local reasoning about global properties with comparatively low manual effort. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on three parameterized case studies, including an automotive control system.",

While many solutions have been proposed to generate specifications, their evaluations and comparisons to other tools are limited. As a result, it is unclear what the best approaches for specification inference are and how these impact the overall specification writing process. In this paper we take steps to address this problem by providing an overview of specification inference tools that can be used for deductive verification of Java programs. For each tool, we discuss its approach to specification inference and identify its advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, we identify the types of specifications that it infers and use this to estimate the impact of the tool on the overall specification writing process. Finally, we identify the ideal features of a specification generator and discuss important challenges for future research.}

abstract="Although software verification is evolving fast in both theoretical and practical aspects, it still remains absent from the actual industrial production cycle. Case studies can help to encourage these integrations. We report on our experiences applying software verification in several projects with industry. In particular, we report on two projects on the verification of tunnel control software at Technolution, where we go from a high-level design to concrete code. These case studies show the power of combining model checking (using mCRL2) and deductive verification (using VerCors) as complementary approaches. We also report on a project with Thales, where we looked at antenna bearing control software, and specified this based on their requirements documents. For all cases, we report on lessons learned and on directions for future work to improve both our tool and the industrial methodology for ensuring software correctness. Notably, our second case study involves the modelling and verification of critical software by a team of engineers from Technolution. This case study is an ongoing project; we describe our experience on the team's learning curve for this experiment and present the preliminary conclusions on the case study.",

abstract = "Sorting is one of the fundamental operations in computer science, and many sequential and parallel algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Swap-based sorting algorithms are one category of sorting algorithms where elements are swapped repeatedly to achieve the desired order. Since these algorithms are widely used in practice, their (functional) correctness, i.e., proving sortedness and permutation properties, is of utmost importance. However, proving the permutation property using automated program verifiers is much more challenging as the formal definition of this property involves existential quantifiers. In this paper, we propose a generic pattern to verify the permutation property for any sequential and parallel swap-based sorting algorithm automatically. To demonstrate our approach, we use VerCors, a verification tool based on separation logic for concurrent and parallel programs, to verify the permutation property of bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, parallel odd-even transposition sort, quick sort, two in-place merge sorts and TimSort for any arbitrary size of input.",

abstract = "Over the years, researchers have developed many formal method tools to support software development. However, hardly any studies are conducted to determine whether the actual problems developers encounter are sufficiently addressed. For the relatively young field of GPU programming, we would like to know whether the tools developed so far are sufficient, or whether some problems still need attention. To this end, we first look at what kind of problems programmers encounter in OpenCL and CUDA. We gather problems from Stack Overflow and categorise them with card sorting. We find that problems related to memory, synchronisation of threads, threads in general and performance are essential topics. Next, we look at (verification) tools in industry and research, to see how these tools addressed the problems we discovered. We think many problems are already properly addressed, but there is still a need for easy to use sound tools. Alternatively, languages or programming styles can be created, that allows for easier checking for soundness.",

To demonstrate this progress, and to bring the area of deductive program verification even further, we have proposed the VerifyThis Collaborative Long Term Challenge, which calls upon the program verification community to verify different aspects of a realistic software application over a period of several months. Goal of the challenge is to foster collaboration in order to verify a realistic and industrially-relevant software application. This paper outlines the considerations that we made when selecting the challenge, and discusses how we believe it will encourage collaboration. It presents the software application that was selected for the challenge in 2019–2020, discusses the practical set up of the challenge, and briefly reports on the received solutions and an online workshop where the different solutions were presented.",

title = "Improving Performance of the VerCors Program Verifier",
abstract = "As program verification tools are becoming more powerful, and are used on larger programs, their performance also becomes more and more important. In this paper we investigate performance bottlenecks in the VerCors program verifier. Moreover, we also discuss two solutions to the identified performance bottlenecks: an improved encoding of arrays, as well as a technique to automatically generate trigger expressions to guide the underlying prover when reasoning about quantifiers. For both solutions we measure the effect on the performance. We see that the new encoding vastly reduces the verification time of certain programs, while other programs keep showing comparable times. This effect remains when moving to newer backends for VerCors.",

abstract="Model checking algorithms are typically complex graph algorithms, whose correctness is crucial for the usability of a model checker. However, establishing the correctness of such algorithms can be challenging and is often done manually. Mechanising the verification process is crucially important, because model checking algorithms are often parallelised for efficiency reasons, which makes them even more error-prone. This paper shows how the VerCors concurrency verifier is used to mechanically verify the parallel nested depth-first search (NDFS) graph algorithm of Laarman et al. [25]. We also demonstrate how having a mechanised proof supports the easy verification of various optimisations of parallel NDFS. As far as we are aware, this is the first automated deductive verification of a multi-core model checking algorithm.",

abstract="Modern concurrent and distributed software is highly complex. Techniques to reason about the correct behaviour of such software are essential to ensure its reliability. To be able to reason about realistic programs, these techniques must be modular and compositional as well as practical by being supported by automated tools. However, many existing approaches for concurrency verification are theoretical and focus on expressivity and generality. This paper contributes a technique for verifying behavioural properties of concurrent and distributed programs that makes a trade-off between expressivity and usability. The key idea of the approach is that program behaviour is abstractly modelled using process algebra, and analysed separately. The main difficulty is presented by the typical abstraction gap between program implementations and their models. Our approach bridges this gap by providing a deductive technique for formally linking programs with their process-algebraic models. Our verification technique is modular and compositional, is proven sound with Coq, and has been implemented in the automated concurrency verifier VerCors. Moreover, our technique is demonstrated on multiple case studies, including the verification of a leader election protocol.",

abstract="Distributed systems are notoriously difficult to develop correctly, due to the concurrency in their communicating subsystems. Several techniques are available to help developers to improve the reliability of message passing software, including deductive verification and model checking. Both these techniques have advantages as well as limitations, which are complementary in nature. This paper contributes a novel verification technique that combines the strengths of deductive and algorithmic verification to reason elegantly about message passing concurrent programs, thereby reducing their limitations. Our approach allows to verify data-centric properties of message passing programs using concurrent separation logic (CSL), and allows to specify their communication behaviour as a process-algebraic model. The key novelty of the approach is that it formally bridges the typical abstraction gap between programs and their models, by extending CSL with logical primitives for proving deductively that a program refines its process-algebraic model. These models can then be analysed via model checking, using mCRL2, to reason indirectly about the program's communication behaviour. Our verification approach is compositional, comes with a mechanised correctness proof in Coq, and is implemented as an encoding in Viper.",

This verification has been performed using VerCors. We also demonstrate how our mechanized correctness proof allows verifying various optimisations of parallel NDFS with only little extra effort.The second part contributes an abstraction technique for verifying global behavioural properties of shared-memory concurrent software. This abstraction technique allows specifying program behavior as a process-algebraic model, with an elegant algebraic structure. Furthermore, we extend CSL with logical primitives that allow one to prove that a program refines its process-algebraic specification. This abstraction technique is proven sound using Coq and is implemented in VerCors. We demonstrate our approach on various examples, including a real-world case study from industry that concerns safety-critical code.In part three, we lift our abstraction technique to the distributed case, by adapting it for verifying message passing concurrent software. This adaptation uses process-algebraic specifications to abstract the communication behavior of distributed agents. We also investigate how model checking of these specifications can soundly be combined with the deductive verification of the specified program.",

Because the failure of software can have devastating effects, being certain that a program does what it is meant to do is crucial. This thesis conducts a case study in deductive verification, which is a sub-area of formal verification. The case study involves a company in the Netherlands and their industrial red-black tree code. This thesis is intended to be an experience report to show how formal verification can be used to help proving the correctness of a program. Ultimately, we want to be able to verify the industrial red-black tree code. However, in this thesis, we only cover the verification of a standard red-black tree code. The main section presents how specifications of a red-black tree can be developed, and the obstacles that are met during the development. Finally, we conclude with the comparisons with the results of other authors and possible future work.}

Our reasoning techniques address different forms of high-level and low-level parallelization. For high-level parallel programs, we first define the Parallel Programming Language (PPL), a simple core language that captures the main features of deterministic parallel programming; then we discuss how PPL programs and consequently, real-world deterministic parallel programs (e.g. OpenMP programs) are verified. For low-level parallel programs, we specifically focus on reasoning about GPGPU kernels. At the end we discuss how the presented verification techniques are chained together to reason about the semantic equivalence of high-level parallel programs where they are automatically transformed to low-level parallel programs by a parallelizing compiler. Thus, effectively enabling a holistic verification solution for such parallelization frameworks.",

    title       = "Specification and verification of synchronisation classes in Java: A practical approach",
    abstract    = "Digital services are becoming an essential part of our daily lives. To provide these services, efficient software plays an important role. Concurrent programming is a technique that developers can exploit to gain more performance. In a concurrent program several threads of execution simultaneously are being executed. Sometimes they have to compete to access shared resources, like memory. This race of accessing shared memories can cause unexpected errors. Programmers use synchronisation constructs to tame the concurrency and control the accesses. In order to develop reliable concurrent software, the correctness of these synchronisation constructs is crucial.In this thesis we use a program logic, called permission-based Separation Logic, to statically reason about the correctness of synchronisation constructs. The logic has the power to reason about correct ownership of threads regarding shared memory. A correctly functioning synchroniser is responsible for exchanging a correct permission when a thread requests access to the shared memory. We use our VERCORS verification tool-set to verify the correctness of various synchronisation constructs.In Chapter 1 we discuss the scope of the thesis. All the required technical background about permission-based Separation Logic and synchronisation classes is explained in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 we discuss how threads' start and join as minimum synchronisation points can be verified. To verify correctness of the synchronisation classes we have to first specify expected behaviour of the classes. This is covered in Chapter 4. In this chapter we present a unified approach to abstractly describe the common behaviour of synchronisers. Using our specifications, one is able to reason about the correctness of the client programs that access the shared state through the synchronisers.The atomic classes of java.util.concurrent are the core element of every synchronisation construct implementation. In Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 we propose a specification for atomic classes. Using this contract, we verified the implementation of synchronisation constructs w.r.t to their specifications from Chapter 4. In our proposed contract the specification of the atomic classes is parameterized with the protocols and resource invariants. Based on the context, the parameters can be defined. In Chapter 7 we propose a verification stack where each layer of stack verifies one particular aspect of a specified concurrent program in which atomic operations are the main synchronisation constructs. We demonstrate how to verify that a non-blocking data structure is data-race free and well connected. Based on the result of the verification from the lower layers, upper layers can reason about the functional properties of the concurrent data structure.In Chapter 8 we present a sound specification and verification technique to reason about data race freedom and functional correctness of GPU kernels that use atomic operations as synchronisation mechanism.Finally, Chapter 9 concludes the thesis with future directions.",

manner. In this research we investigate what performance bottlenecks are in
the VerCors verification tool for concurrent programs. The aim is to identify
the cause of a performance bottleneck, in order to optimize the tool.
We introduce a technique to identify what properties of a program are more
difficult to verify. Using those results, we present solutions to two performance
bottlenecks that were identified: 1. An alternative encoding of arrays is implemented
in the tool which allows the tool to reason up to 4 times faster about
programs that make use of arrays. 2. Our research in generating triggers for
quantified expressions show that speedups up to 30% are possible. Though further
research is required to investigate if this solution can be generalized and
optimized further.}

Active Object are not a build-in feature of the Java programming language. For asynchronous method calls, we used the Java Future interface to return result values. We created a formal specification for the Java Future interface and proved a simple implementation correct using the VerCors tool set.
We implemented the communication to Active Objects using message passing with the MPJ Express library. To verify this implementation, the message passing library has been annotated and a definition of valid messages in this program is given. We also annotated our implementation, however we encountered problems annotating the returning of result values. The annotations require a lot of administrative overhead and are hard to get correct. 
Also the existing VerCors tool set is not capable yet to automatically verify the program, mainly because it lacks support for output parameters or sum notation in the process algebra for futures.}

The software that is verified with VerCors (and similar tools) use common data types such as lists or sets. The behavior of these data types is modeled in VerCors using axiomatic data types (ADTs). VerCors currently supports axiomatic data types such as sequences/lists, sets, and bags. To extend the support for ADTs, a list of features to add to VerCors was compiled by using input from end-users. An implementation-level view of VerCors is given with general approaches to implementing a feature in VerCors. For each feature in this list a definition is given, its encoding into Viper (the back end of VerCors) is discussed and its implementation using the general approaches is explained.}

abstract    = {In the age where one software bug can cost millions, software correctness is paramount. Static verifiers are used more and more in both academia and industry to prevent these costly bugs. They can formally prove that an implementation adheres to a specification. With the recent increased use of concurrency, proving correctness of software has become more challenging. However, progress is being made in this area: several static verifiers can now also verify languages in concurrent environments. Unfortunately their features are lagging behind: most checkers do not proceed beyond the prototyping phase and do not tackle the more practical language features. To improve the situation, this work presents an approach for implementing verification support for exceptions and inheritance as presented in Java. We also present, in great detail, the transformation of a language with exceptions and inheritance into a language without, and discuss the theory underlying the practical support for exceptions and inheritance. Finally, we briefly evaluate the approaches for both exceptions and inheritance, and discuss what can be further improved in static verification.},
